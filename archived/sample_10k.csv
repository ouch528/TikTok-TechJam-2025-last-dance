They first told me that customer service would take care of the issue but not only they didn’t do anything, they wasted so much time that the person that stole my money had more than enough time to run away. The first time I was here, I witness shoplifting in this location and employees saw it happening, but they didn’t seem to give a damn.
I always avoided this location after this, it’s the 2nd time here and just stopped by to buy a couple of items since I was driving by, and decided to withdraw some money, never again I’ll set foot here.
Go to any other Walmart location, this is the worst Walmart I’ve been in my life! Everyone knows that Walmarts for the most part are not fancy and can be pretty ratchet (I can deal with some ratchetness), but this place is as ghetto and dangerous as it gets.

The high point was Laura's sales pitch, which made us feel very comfortable that they could assist my family in dealing with my mom's tiny estate after she passed away.  The low point was a little further down the road when we were already committed to using their services.  Laura blatantly ignored our emails and phone calls for weeks at a time.  Sometimes 3 weeks!  We had simple, legitimate questions regarding this straight forward probate case.  The only way I could get a response was to keep calling and begging her receptionist.  Eventually, someone would call or write, and they always offered the same stale excuse...  they were having personnel issues.  ""So so sorry."" Probate took much longer than expected; it really felt like they were too busy with their more important clients than to work with us.  I get it....  we're a small fish in the legal world, but we were still a paying client, and their ""services"" aren't exactly cheap.  So, now, we walk away not even knowing if our family's best interest(s) have even been served.  There's no real way for us to know, but it sure doesn't feel like it.  It's surprising and irritating to read all the positive reviews for this place...   how on earth?  I guess if you're willing to take a chance, maybe you'll be among the lucky ones.

Gyro - Frozen meat, badly made homemade Tzatziki, little or no cucumbers.

Boston Cream pie. Obviously this is contracted out if the Gyro meat is frozen. Need new bakery or food rep.

I’m not a fan of doing these, this is someone’s livelihood, however having a tremendous menu, doesn’t make you a tremendous restaurant.

My teen was in an accident on the highway going to school in the morning.  She was driving my car so I could not get to her and her father works at the base so he had atleast 20 minutes before he could get to her. Brad was there within seconds for her he was able to get to her before the Nevada highway patrol even.  I’ll never be able to repay him for his compassion for us above his business with us.  I’ll never leave his office or StateFarm and it comes down to how very much they all will go that extra time and mile to make sure they have us covered in all aspects of our insurance needs. So to read these comments of negativity about this office and/or persons is troubling to me to say the least.  Just so you know we do not associate with Mr Stokes out of his office or staff outside of our insurance needs so our thoughts and positivity on this office and persons are from direct face to face and hands on experience we are not friends outside the office.  Mr. Stokes will always be remembered as the best agent we’ve had just from the fact that he was there to make sure our most precious treasure, our daughter, was safe and secure and someone we trust was able to be there for us till we could get to her side.  We’d never leave this company ever and I tell everyone that this is the best office and agent that we have in this little town.",,,0x809886f3c3c3f2b5:0xc3565066ecdb8958

No one to really ask where to go for a Nevada ID and register a vehicle because they are busy getting yelled at. First, we could hear two people raising their voices from frustration to the staff but I expected it since I know how americans love the DMV (LOL). Came here without an appointment but I expected to wait at least 2-1/2 hours and I was correct. The total time was 3 hours in a musical chair-like line (the funniest thing I've ever seen in my life). I don't know who came up with this idea but it was incredibly  stupid. Finally, we she a lady who seem very nice.....no problem with her. But this is what really got under my skin and if I was in a worse mood, I would have lost it. I'm a working man who is use to working 5 days a week.....minimum. It costs money to take a day off and I lost it. Getting back to the story......my wife got her license and photo....great. But because I didn't have my birth certificate I wasn't able to get mine. She said I needed it but online it clearly states...""Need birth certificate OR out-of-state drivers license."" I HAD IT! But.......GOT DENIED because she wanted it. At this point, I just wanted to push her computer off the desk because I was that pissed. I hate missing work and the last thing I wanted was to be at the DMV. So we walked out with only my wife's ID, furthermore finding out that we needed smog inspection to register the vehicle which south Texas has zero of that. As long as the vehicle is safe to drive. But I guess that comes with the west......it's fine.

Please for the love of God make an appointment and make sure you have beyond what you need. Bring your baby hand prints too! They may ask for it even if their online site doesn't say! I'm dreading going back for my temporary license for my clunker...... :'(",,,0x80993f53942dd1d9:0x72f6cd95bb1cfd00

We normally go to Vegas about 2-4 time a year but this was the first time taking our 11 month Dog Daughter Peggy. I searched for a location and found Z pet Hotel and it was the best decision we made for our baby.

We normally stay at the Delano where they charge about $100 extra to keep her with us in the room. She's an English bulldog so the most activity we get from her is a quick 5 min zummies and then she's out and the regular bathroom breaks. So for about the same price with Z pet hotel she gets her own suite and a beautiful queen size bed all to herself.  We were able to venture out more and not worry about calling if were we wanted to go accepted pets. Zaneta the coordinator was very knowledgeable of the breed and new what her needs would be and was so attentive to how we have her spoiled. She kept us informed and sent daily pictures of how Peggy played with others and her resting throughout the day.

Over all I wish there were more locations like this so we would be able to take our Peggy on vacations and have her well taken care of like this.   If your thinking of visiting or just having your pet baby stay for a night it's so worth the peace of mind.

Thank you for the service you provide Z pet Hotel.

Follow them on Instagram and you can see Peggys stay there.",,,0x80c8c72bba3e3a57:0xffa6b503f0c3f6f8

My breaker box is located on the outside of the home in the rear of the building. They removed the old box then chiseled out an area large enough to accommodate the new box. They surrounded it with some type of thin plaster which deteriorated within a few weeks. I told Bill of this development and he assured me that they would send someone out to repair the plaster.  I spend a lot of time away from home for work so after a month of travel I would return to find that the work had not been completed. I would contact Bill again and he would apologize then promise the repair would be done the next day. I would go out of town only to return to find nothing had been done. The cycle repeated over and over and over until I realized they got my money and they would not be providing any addition service or support. All I wanted was that they finish the job right and I couldn't get that no matter how hard I tried. Eventually Bill no longer responded to my pleas to finish the job. Truly disappointing.,[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO0l54JUaC7DBcq1RQeOGIPaNyaeCr7cVBgkc_K=w150-h150-k-no-p']}],"{'time': 1607712210324, 'text': 'I am very sorry this turned out this way.

The only reason I can't give a 5 is that Sixt's instructions to get to their off-site rental office are a bit confusing.

Once we got there, our check-in team was great and even asked about our trip and gave us some ideas about places to visit.

I was here with a group of 7 other girls, and we were all extremely disappointed with the service we received. Our waiter was curt, inattentive, and the opposite of warm and friendly. At one point, one of my friends found some plastic packaging material in her vegetables, and when she brought it to the attention of the waiter, he asked where it was and then proceeded to take her plate away, without expressing any form of concern or apology. He didn't even offer to bring her a new plate, and when she volunteered that she didn't want a replacement plate, he curtly replied ""okay"" before walking away.

We were so displeased that we ended up asking for the manager to express our concerns. This turned our evening around somewhat. The manager listened patiently to everything we had to say, genuinely apologized, said he would address the issue with the waiter, and offered to buy us a round of drinks. We did decline, but he ensured that he added a discount to our bill at the end of the night, which was a nice touch in making up for our earlier experience.

It was a pity our experience with the service started off on such a sour note, which shaped the rest of the evening, as otherwise the food, ambience and music was lovely.",,,0x80c8c415f7af7741:0xe8a957980a17f1f9

Gold, in this case is an optimal word, as upon first sight one might shake their head and say , ""Nice place, but I don't get all the hype.""
Let's just put it this way, there are certain gold miners out there that these words will speak to. From there, as with all gold mining adventures, I wouldn't want to give you the exact prospecting coordinates, as that would spoil the fun of the discovery. Good luck, my friend.
P.S. If you happen to encounter a miner by the name of Alex, Danny, or Jessica- you will know you are headed in the right direction.",,,0x80c8be43d6549fcb:0x87aaef346a1310ec

106088577414686226757,Ginny Lei,1483552651332,1.0,"First of all, that lady in the office that screams at everyone, really?  It's wonderful to walk into a sales office and all you hear is some lady screaming for everyone from her office.

Next, there's some new lady down there, looks like she's suppose to be the lot manager however all she seems to do is flirt with two of the lot porters.  My guess is, she's there to get some and not actually work as I didn't see her do anything.

The employees seem to do nothing.  Most of them seem to congregate at the back of the building and do nothing.  Sales guys don't even come and greet me when I step on the lot as a paying customer.

There are 2 or 3 people there that actually work and 2 of them I understand are lot porters from what they said and the other I believe is the GM.  Don't know their names but they are both white and have beards.  One of them is newer but everytime I have been there, those were the two nicest and most helpful people ever - never rude like the remaining staff employeed.

Lastly, what the hell has happened to the product you put out.  Back a year ago, you actually could get in a car, start it and there weren't any issues.  I'm afraid if I bring a client in to buy a car, they are going to not get the car and it will spend days even weeks being repaired after the fact.  I didn't think the point of a used car lot was to put cars up unclean, unfinished (missing parts) and give them a ""well fix it if you buy it"" line.  I've been to many car lots and I originally chose yours because of the great deals you have and the ability to loan to the most down on their luck people.  But to buy a car that isn't going to start?   That is some real ""slum lord"" type quality there.",,,0x80c8c71bc1498d9b:0x7221f094e8f59a1e

I had an appointment and they were not ready to take me when I arrived.

Rather than seating me, asking if I would mind waiting a few minutes, offering me color options, I was just treated rudely and ignored. The only person who bothered to address me barely looked up from what he was doing and they had three staff members there working on only two people.

I don’t know why the service was so horrible and the atmosphere was so cold. I’ve never been there before but I am a good customer who tips well and I will certainly never be back. Very disappointing.

If you like games such as csgo or generally like guns I would suggest the GI Jane package, switch the pistol with a glock as it has more recoil, and add an ak47 with 50 rounds for $50.

The ak47 has a giant muzzle flare compared to the other guns you generally would use in the packages and the number of shots for the price is pretty good too :)

Service was great and everyone there was extremely helpful and friendly.

Just remember if you can't hear someone in the shooting range DO NOT take off your ear protection as some guns are incredibly loud.

I wanted my pants to be altered modernly (slim and fitted) and looked up on google the best tailors in town. I saw a few good rated ones but I checked their reviews and most of them usually catered to women's and their dresses. So I continued looking and saw Milano's Fashion, I liked it right away because they usually deal with suits and I know for sure that this guy knows what he's doing. So I called him up and asked him upfront how much he charges for pants alteration, in a polite way he told me that he needs to measure me first before he quotes me anything. So I drove there in his shop. Upon entering, I was welcomed with a warm smile and a jolly personality, he introduced himself and he told me his name is Joe. Then we went on to business and he measured me up then and there. After measuring I was expecting that he would charge me a lot (basing from the suits he sells), but I was surprised on how reasonable and affordable his quote for me is. After a few days I came back to pick my pants up and when I tried them on, I looked at it and I knew at that moment that I made the right decision. These are the kinds of businesses Las Vegas needs more of. Thanks a lot Joe!",,,0x80c8c4fef9f35487:0x54a7c640b6552861

I wish I had looked at the reviews before renting from them as all the reviews concerning undisclosed service charges are true. I was charged roughly $120 in excess fees because I chose to use my own car insurance company to insure the car for damages. Although the company states I signed the contract, at no point was the price for declinging their insurance given verbally or within the contract. When I discussed the prices with the services representative and the manager, their response was beyond inadequate.

Furthermore, when I picked up the car, despite the car being rented as smoke free, the car smelt like an ash tray. It was so bad it made one of my passengers sick.

Finally someone who I believe was a receptionist came in and helped her and finally had to take over, the receptionists and this lady were the only decent people in this entire building.  Horrible bed side manor, the dental hygienist was so rude and didn’t put much care into cleaning my teeth. The dentist had horrible bed side manor and besides that I was lied to about needing a crown and the amount I was told I would have to pay out of pocket for a crown did not coincide with what the insurance company told me once I called them to double check. I knew right away I wasn’t going to trust getting any work done by them and turns out after visiting other offices and finally letting another dentist do my work that I made the right decision by not trusting gentle dental.

Move 4 Less out performed their promises.  I needed a move from my parents' house to an assisted living facility into a one bedroom apartment.  As part of the move, we needed Move 4 Less to move a refrigerator to my house and a couch to my daughter's house, a total of three stops.  The estimator that came to my house gave me a quote of $395.00 total.  Move 4 Less was professional at all stages.  They arrived within the promised window of time and prompted me by text when they were 15 minutes away and then again when they were 5 minutes away.  The driver and his helper were businesslike but the most efficient moving duo I have ever encountered and extremely polite.  They swiftly wrapped all of the furniture, disassembled where necessary and had the truck loaded in 35 minutes.  They efficient off loaded the truck without any damage to any of the furniture.  They were careful to reassemble the furniture and to place it exactly where I instructed them.  THE FINAL BILL WAS $297.00,  which is almost 25% less than the quote.   THIS COMPANY WITH RESPECT TO MY MOVE DESERVES MORE THAN 5 STARS.",,"{'time': 1589816075651, 'text': 'Thank you so much Steven!! This is outstanding to hear and we are so happy to have helped out.

Celeste was prepared with a bunch of food, snacks, sandwiches, water for us, sunscreen, etc.  My wife and I had a very well maintained tandem kayak with a rudder, and Celeste had the equipment well prepared and ready.

107217525364952558068,Ridge Green,1604457397824,5.0,"The Crack Shack has hands down the absolute best fried chicken experience in all of Vegas. I shared a small flock meal with my family off of a dining credit from our hotel and was blown away by the sheer quality of each individual item as well as how great the dining area and staff were.

The location right on the strip is great, and being connected to a MGM property is a nice perk for those with food credits or simply due to proximity. The dining room has massive televisions that are great for watching sports and although the bar was closed when I visited, it looked like a perfect place for some suds while watching a game. The manager was great because he not only worked alongside his employees but was very attentive to customer feedback and making sure everyone was happy, which is of course expected from a place with a pricetag like Crack Shack's, but honestly often overlooked here in Vegas.

But of course the real draw isn't the indie tunes on the speakers or the kitschy murals of chickens recreating Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas but the excellent Jidori chicken. I'm not going to go over the particulars of what makes this chicken so much better than average fair, but I admit, I entered skeptical and left a believer. It really is the kobe of the chicken world. The chicken is fresh, juicy and falls right off the bone. The spice has great heat, but not enough to detract from the meat or the breading. And just because the chicken is the star of the show doesn't mean the sides were neglected!

Crack Shack has delicious mini biscuits with a tasty miso maple butter, duck and chicken fat fries and killer slaw! All of these come in healthy amounts, and after a long day of vacationing it fed three hungry adults to the brim for only $55.

Overall, the Crack Shack can seem daunting but the fun environment, unparalleled reimagining of a classic american dish and stellar location makes this restaurant a must visit for those who are visiting anywhere near the MGM Park area.",[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMlZAgcwcHbdQYEX2jgkCtjS882lynWiuHOMYwO=w150-h150-k-no-p']}],"{'time': 1604960019177, 'text': 'Tony, you brought tears to my eyes 😊 Thank you for your stellar review and guests like you make it all worth it!

Back then,  they had an above ground (above stage) water tank, and the members of the show would dive in, and you could see them do various stunts under water. Now the water is stage level, so you can't see under it,  but it's much more versatile. We had a good time.

There's no speaker/intercom at the window and I couldn't even hear what the man was saying with all the traffic noise just a few feet behind me. I didn't feel safe standing out there with the amount of precious metals I was carrying. Frustrated I turned around and left. I saw that famous pawn shop across the street and decided to go there. They had 3 visible security guards at the door. I felt safer there. I'm pretty sure I didn't get the best price for my items. And based on what I heard, Waikiki offers the best prices in town. But I'll never know. In case you want to know what I sold to the store across the street, look at the picture I uploaded.",,,0x80c8c39cbe0e1f45:0xa26efc90804e44b1

109796812301536990867,Taylor Rice,1556680133988,1.0,"BEWARE OF REGISTERING YOUR DOG ONLINE -- I registered my pup quickly and did not read through all of the agreements... apparently just by registering you are agreeing to a monthly subscription. When I went in to Barx Parx, I only paid $40 initial enrollment for one month. (I thought I was just going to pay for this first month to see how my dog liked it). After about 2 weeks, my dog did not enjoy the park so I did not return. 3 months later, I realized I was being charged MONTHLY for a subscription service. When I called to inquire, the woman on the phone told me that I had signed up for this subscription service online even though I was entirely unaware of it. She refused to refund me for the past three months I had not gone, and said that she would even be generous by waiving the next month's fee because I was supposed to give 30 days notice before canceling the subscription that I didn't even know I signed up for... (mind you, I was charged for this month's ""subscription"" less than a week ago)

Responding to what the owner wrote below: I NEVER told you that I said “no” to your employee asking me if I only wanted to do one month. I DEFINITELY would have said yes, in fact, I’m pretty sure I told them that I only wanted to try it because my dog wouldn’t be able to come in a month anyway because he is not neutered. I apparently “agreed” to your subscription service online— of which there were so many things to agree to that I was unaware and I do take responsibility for that. Also, not wanting to get my dog neutered is NOT the reason I didn’t want to continue... I have planned to get him neutered at 1 year old, so I KNEW I wouldn’t be able to attend in a month since your rules say they must be neutered after they are 6 months old. But honestly the reason I am upset isn’t because of your policy or because I have to pay for months that I didn’t attend — and couldn’t have even attended if I wanted to— it is because of how your tone on the phone was very accusatory and honestly somewhat rude to a paying customer who simply made a mistake and was calling to inquire why I was charged.",,"{'time': 1556589744508, 'text': 'Hi Taylor, I’m sorry that you did not understand what you were signing up for when you opted to purchase a Barx Parx monthly membership after your dog passed his assessment with flying colors.\n\nAfter passing the behavior assessment, all customers are presented with the option to either choose to purchase a membership or to go the day pass route. You opted for the membership route and decided to not go with single day passes. Everyone is shown the membership laminate that fully illustrates each option along with their monthly price, enrollment fee and cancellation policy. You chose which membership level you wanted, paid the one-time $40 enrollment fee, added your credit card on file with us, and then signed the online agreement that approved recurring charges on a monthly basis.\n\nUnlike other membership based facilities, we have no contract locking you in for any specific amount of time. We are as transparent as possible and also only charge a one-time enrollment fee, not an annual fee. All members are more than welcome to cancel at any given time, as long as they provide a 30-day notice. This is stated in both the online agreement that you chose to sign as well as on the membership laminate that you reviewed on site.\n\nWe’ve been open for 10 months and have never had any other customer confused about our membership sign up process, however, I heard you out, respected your decision to cancel (per you not wanting your dog to get neutered, not the reason you mentioned in your review) and promised that we would absolutely circle back with our staff to ensure that we are clearer explaining what memberships are. I also asked you over the phone if you let our staff know when you signed up that you only wanted it to be for one month, and your answer was “no”.\n\nThanks for giving us a shot and I’m sorry that things didn’t work out. Best of luck to you and your adorable pup.'}",0x80c8ce3604c34e65:0x7ef52bd710b822c7

104107113113285568473,Kevin Dang,1463509341783,5.0,"Sushi business is cut-throat in Las Vegas. There are soooo many of them and the reviews are all over the board for any one joint. I tend to like the traditional sushi restaurants where simple nigiris are served. And if omakase is offered, I always take up the chef's choice option because that's when you get to try the seasonal fish (if you didn't know what to order). Many a times I get introduced to new sushi this way.

I chose to come to Naked Fish's Sushi because the Google reviews seemed to come from folks who enjoyed sushi (and not rolls, although this place does serve rolls). Nobody mentioned omakase, but I was pleasantly surprised to learn that it was offered.

The sushi chefs were Japanese (Chef Ryu & Chef Aki) and they did a fabulous job. They served me Shima Aji, Kinmedai (golden eye snapper), Kare (flounder), Hamachi Belly, Salmon Belly, Hirame, Japanese & Santa Barbara Uni, Mirugai, Scallop, Hotaru Ika (firefly squid), and finished off with two OToro (one seared, one plain).

The Japanese uni had better texture because the pieces were smaller; but taste-wise, it was almost the same as the SB uni. The hotate (scallop) was topped with sea salt and lined with a small piece of shiso leaf underneath that I wasn't expecting, but I love the flavor. I was slightly disappointed with the Otoro because the texture were a bit rugged and not the melts-in-your-mouth feel.

Overall, I loved this place. My meal came about to be about $80 (with Hamachi carpaccio appetizer). I hope to try it again when I'm in Las Vegas.",,,0x80c8c754b75dec6f:0xcb501a94935ac8fb

And I rarely give reviews because usually it’s people complaining about petty things. But today I had to at least for someone else to be careful if you have work done here.

The problem is my husband phone wasn’t working properly we went in to repair the “owner” said it would be $129 for repair my husband thought it was a little much so we left. Then he stopped us stating he could get the part from another store and it would only be $89 so my husband said ok. He said it would take 45 min. When we picked it up it looked great. How ever I noticed later that night it looked dark all around the edges I mentioned it to my husband but he thought it was the video we were watching. The following day my husband noticed as he touched the screen it was doing other things so we called and he said sure come on down.

We went “owner” he said we replaced your screen which we had no idea that’s what he had done since the original wasn’t cracked or anything. He said it’s normal that the brightness wouldn’t be the same however at the time we were unable to duplicate what had happened earlier.

So it’s now been 5 days and my husband said it’s getting worse let’s go back and we did however the “owner” isn’t the friendliest person maybe that’s just how he is my husband asked if he remembered us he just stared and acted like he was irrelevant. My husband asked again and he said yes so then my husband gave him the phone he went into the back and then came out stating to my husband had dropped the phone and he would charge him $50 for repair. Well my husband just said no I am not paying again we came with the issue just on Saturday and you said it was normal however it is not and we left. Once in the car he noticed a black spot on the screen that wasn’t there prior. These OEM parts are far from authentic and to risk your $1200 iPhone is a very poor decision.

I should have known better to only trust Apple store. But because of these times we had to go to this location and because of his amazing reviews I really thought we had found an amazing place.

They have super amazing reviews and I really thought he was authentic. However again never trust anyone.

Twenty minutes later we discovered our name was not on the list.  It seems that a bus boy was an hour late arriving and they had no one to cover either his job or the hostess's job.

I’ve passed this place a thousand times but never noticed it. I searched for something a little different at 4:30am & bam!!! Ronald’s pops up. 4am-4pm & the freshest, dense, yet somehow still extremely light & fluffy, & incredibly delicious. I did get one non vegan donut (it was an orangey flavored kind of donut) & as delicious as it was it still was not as amazing as the vegan ones.

Plain, Custard (my ultimate favorite), orange, & an apple empanada (also extremely tasty) were the several that I decided to try this first time. Oh & I will be back!

If you read no further than the following, you must simply know – This is the only place in the valley you should consider for any firearm or ammunition needs. The owner and staff who were present during my transaction all greeted me, were incredibly friendly, possessed great knowledge with exceptional answers to all of my inquiries, and completed all of the aforementioned without sporting the condescending and demeaning attitude you will find in every other shop I’ve visited (In all fairness I have not been to them all….but I have a great many). In terms of FFL transfers not only was the preceding the reason they earned my business, but the fact they had the lowest price I was able to find. They were able to supply me with my blue card (Nevada registration) as well which saved me a trip to the police station. It is never the positive feedback that is composed (or read), simply the negative, and I would like this to serve as a testament to how positive of experience I had at this store (not to mention I am sacrificing time with my new love to inform you all!).

When I checked the reviews on YELP I found some other customers got the similar experience as me but the Eco Friendly Air didn’t reply or replied in rude ways. That’s why I have to post my review to avoid more people get involved in the similar experience by the good reviews on Google Map. I learnt a lesson that I should check out more reviews on different social media especially pay attention to the risk before choosing the service provider.
I called Eco Friendly Air for fixing my heater. They charged me $89 for the checking fee before checking and then told me they diagnosed the problem was caused by the ignition part. It need to be replaced and the price was $617. so I had another company to check it and get a second opinion to verify the price and after checking they asked $580 to repair it, no checking fee required.
Comparing the prices, I would pay less than $580 if the paid checking fee $89 could be deducted as they promised so I called Eco Friendly Air again, they required to pay a full payment of $625.40 before they start fixing it. It raised $8.40 as I shopped around and I was required to pay $536.50 (checking fee deducted since I use their service, otherwise it’s not refundable.) The manager Philip had explained how hard to find the old part without any model No. before charging me but when I paid at 1pm I was told they could come over to fix it with the new part ready at 3pm that afternoon. After over 2 hours fixing yesterday, I was told by the technician Tom that there was another problem he couldn’t diagnose. He came this morning to continue diagnosing the problem. After almost one hour, I was told the gas valve is broken and need to be changed which will charge me $680+. I called the manager Philip and he explained the reason they couldn’t diagnose the problem of the gas valve for the first time is that the machine parts work in sequence. Without the problem of the ignition solved they couldn’t diagnose the problem of the next step occurred by the gas valve which is the last step of the process. I started to doubt their honestness. So I had thought of the checking report by the second opinion I ignored and checked it out. It shows that the problem was caused by the gas valve. It broke the manager Philip’s lies. I called that company to confirm it and got to know the ignition parts worked well when they checked it and the bad gas valve was the reason they diagnosed. It was one day after Eco Friendly Air’s manager Philip and technician Tom’s checking up. That means I paid $625.50 to Eco Friendly Air for nothing improved which is not refundable. That’s why I realized that I’m cheated by Eco Friendly Air and why they had to clarify before start their job that if there would be any other problems except the ignition part I need to pay extra money to cover other part cost and repair fee. I called the manager Philip to tell him the whole story. He still tried to keep his words reliable by some so called technical items. When I told him I will sue the company to the small business court he became rude and refused my call.
Updates: I called to the company to file a complaint and left a message 15 minutes ago. The manager Philip called me back and he rudely pointed that It seems that I’m a scammer who tried to get a free service. It’s really ridiculous that the service provider who hasn’t fix the AC well but already charged me full payment of $625.50 for AC fixing before providing service including $89 checking fee charged before checking told that I’m a scammer...",,,0x80c8e9e28ac5e711:0x9ca28833c77ff8b

I looked at the display case and said you're out of cookies. She said we have some in the back. Seems like an odd thing to do when you could stock your display and entice customers to but them. I asked for chocolate chip. She said they were all out. I told her that every time I ask for chocolate chip cookies you are out. WHY? The kid making sandwiches said they just baked a bunch and they all disappeared. So I replied why don't you take you smart mouth to the back and make more of the freakin cookies that everyone seems to want. All I got was a sorry.

I was quite dissapointed with my experience. Being Gordon Ramsay branded, I was expecting what you would find in the Commonwealth nations like UK, Australia and New Zealand.

I was surprised to realise no mushy peas were served, this is quintessential UK.

The fish was cooked to perfection, but very tasteless. Was it basa? I would suggest using fresh baramundi if possible due to the richer flavour which would suit the price point much more.

The chips were....... Well, not what you'd expect going to the UK/Australia/New Zealand. It's great they're made from fresh potatoes but it isn't the experience one would expect from a restaurant branded as Gordon Ramsay with UK decor.

I was really excited for what I was hoping would be some amazing fish and chips like what you can get in the Commonwealth. Unfortunately all it has done is make me miss home a lot and eager to get back to eating Commonwealth style fish and chips.

For all Americans who think this is amazing, I highly suggest you travel abroad - your mind will be blown with the quality and freshness of what the UK, New Zealand and Australia all class as a national institution.

We flew out to Las Vegas and met with Paul Sallach who spent a great deal of time showing us the aircraft and briefing myself and my 3 guests with all the latest info on how this new Jet works. We went up over the Hoover Dam and Grand Canyon, it was an absolutely amazing experience! I’ve had some left seat time at the controls of a Gulfstream G3 and a G550 at FL450, but the Vision Jet is really the future of aviation! I’ve heard so many great things about it, and being an instrument rated SR20/22 pilot it really was just as easy to transition to as I’ve heard. There’s really no way to put this experience into a review without saying “You have to check this place out, wow!” My recommendation is to call or email them and find a time you will be in Vegas next with friends or family and it will be an epic time. If you live in the Las Vegas area and are looking for a quality flight school, look no further than All In Aviation. I’ve trained with multiple flight schools over the past 10 years including 3 Cirrus Platinum Training Centers, but All In Aviation tops the chart for the best aircraft and instructors! 150% highly recommend Paul Sallach and All In Aviation.

If you have an Entertainment book for 2018, you have a coupon for this location, but the prices are higher than what the coupon says on the back, and we had to argue a bit to get our 10% off honored at all. We were told it was a ""very old coupon from a long time ago,"" by the owner, then when we showed the 12/31/18 expiration date, he conceded to honor the 10% off the higher prices. At the end, he only took 5% off, and told me it was because the coupon was only for the adults, not children's meals too. I pointed out that my coupon says 10% of total bill, and he took a little more off. I was too tired and full to check his math or argue, so I just paid and left. The food was good, the restaurant was clean, and the staff was pretty friendly. English isn't spoken much by any of the staff, so be advised if you have food allergies, you will not be able to find out what ingredients may or may not be in any of the food.

Staff suggested rental car agencies and asked if they could help get my truck into their shop. When we arrived late Friday afternoon I was greeted by some of the nicest people I’ve ever met at a car repair business or Ford dealership. Although I needed to rent a car to return home for work and family (a five hour drive) I was assured my truck would be diagnosed before Tuesday.  I rented a car, drove home and got a call on Monday morning with the news and remedy.  I returned early Wednesday morning and was again greeted with smiles and recognition as I got my truck back.
Everyone I spoke with at Fallon Ford was polite and very nice.  I was just an out of towner traveling through and yet they treated me like a friend, neighbor or family.  I cannot say enough nice things about my experience here.

We both ordered a bone-in ribeye, mushrooms, Mac & cheese, broccolini, potato au gratin, and for an appetizer we got the bacon wrapped shrimp. I can’t eat that, as I’m allergic to shellfish, but my boyfriend was excited to try these. When they arrived on the table, the fish smell was OVERBEARING. He had mentioned something to me about it, but I told him I’m sure it’s fine and that doesn’t always necessarily mean it’s bad. So he ate it, not wanted to be the “complaining customer”. He complimented how meaty the shrimp was. We shared all the rest of the food. Even had a cocktail each, and tried each others. We went home, and it wasn’t but and hour later he was vomiting violently. There is no way this shrimp was not the reason. How did the chef and waiters not smell it and think to maybe get a new batch for us? They should know more than us. Anyway - just make sure to turn your food away if it smells fishy, otherwise you’ll be spending $200 on a night with your head in the toilet.",,"{'time': 1615231499424, 'text': 'Hello, we would love the opportunity to ensure your concerns are addressed.

The carpet was ripped by the bath room anf the Night stand drawer were broken. I called maintenance and they came out 45 min later.Jared the maintenance worker was extremely helpful and fixed everything.Next morning I go to the presentation...or bullying session ...the first guy understood that I didn't want it...next they send a young lady who made an offer to try out the timeshare....as soon as i asked questions....she left me to help another person and I was there for over 45 mins. She came back and I said no....she then handed me the folder and say ""good bye have nice day""....her attitude changes instantly....the folks at the front door and around the property attitude changed almost instantly....it was like they couldn't wait to get rid of me or anyone that wasn't interested. This is the last time that I will stay at Diamond Resort. My problem is this....you bring people in to view your property...why put  them in your worse room that has broken fixtures and less than clean sheets....and kiss my ass  when I first arrive then tell me basically to kiss your ass when I said no because I am putting kids  through college.It is a joke and not good Customer service.

Normally, I would give 5/5 but I'm taking off 2 stars because of the unsatisfactory customer service. My wife and I went there to celebrate our honeymoon as newly weds because we heard about all the great service and complimentary desserts Momofuku does for celebration events. On the dinner reservation we put down ""honeymoon"" as our event. However, when we sat down there was no congratulations or even a question as to whether we were celebrating anything. At first, I didn't think much of it but then we heard all the other tables being congratulated for their event or birthday. They were even given complimentary cakes or dessert for their celebration events, while our waiter ""C"" did not ask us once whether the dinner was special. After we paid for the check, I asked our waiter whether Momofuku provides anything for celebration events as we were celebrating our honeymoon. He quickly apologized and brought us a cookie for the way out.

The pad thai is spicy and the pork is almost raw meat and you can cook it in the broth. Meat broth is also thick enough.

That night I was ask 3 different times for my identification...and I was also staying at the hotel at the time...so it had me boggled... Anywho I still love the redlion...

117957801377775997276,Bjoern Hofmann,1570142151297,5.0,"(Translated by Google) I booked the Avi Resort and Casino on a more or less well-planned round trip for 3 days (01.10.-04.10.19) at short notice (30.09.) To relax. For 35 euros per night a huge, clean and above all quiet room (3227 in the beach tower with a view of the parking lot). Parking right in front of the door. The pool is relatively large and can be reached quickly. All clean. Of course everything could be a little bit fancier and hip, but honestly, nothing is really bad here.
We ate at the buffet several times ($ 11 breakfast / brunch & $ 17 dinner; there is a 10% discount if you get such a free PlayersCard). It's not a high-class buffet, but the service is friendly and everything tastes good by US standards.
In addition, there is a small food court (Subway, SBarro Pizza, Panda Express, ice cream parlor) and a normal restaurant.
Not to forget there is childcare, a cinema and a BEACH.
When I read the bad reviews I think people expect Caesars Palace quality for Motel 6 price. Awful.
Compared to Las Vegas, it is much quieter, less hectic and has the charm of a small Caribbean vacation. Just perfect ! I would come back anytime!

Ich habe das Avi Resort und Casino auf einer mehr oder weniger durchgeplanten Rundreise für 3 Tage (01.10.-04.10.19) kurzfristig (30.09.) zum Ausspannen gebucht. Für 35 Euro pro Nacht ein riesiges, sauberes und vor allem ruhiges Zimmer (3227 im Beachtower mit Blick auf den Parkplatz). Parkplatz direkt vor der Tür. Der Pool ist relativ groß und schnell zu erreichen. Alles sauber. Natürlich könnte alles ein wenig schicker und hipper sein, aber ganz ehrlich hier ist nichts wirklich schlecht.
Wir haben mehrfach am Buffet (11 Dollar Frühstück / Brunch & 17 Dollar Abendessen ; es gibt 10% Nachlass, wenn man sich so eine kostenlose PlayersCard holt) gegessen. Es ist kein High-Class Buffet, aber dennoch wird man freundlich bedient und für US-Verhältnisse schmeckt alles.
Darüber hinaus gibt es noch einen kleinen Food Court (Subway, SBarro Pizza, Panda Express, Eisdiele), sowie ein normales Restaurant.
Nicht zu vergessen es gibt eine Kinderbetreuung, ein Kino und einen STRAND.
Wenn ich die schlechten Bewertungen lese, denke ich die Menschen erwarten Caesars-Palace-Qualität für einen Motel-6-Preis. Furchtbar.

So, just took a chance and stopped. I’m so glad I did. From the moment I walked in, I was listened to, acknowledged my concerns. Communication opens of phone, email, text - I love and appreciate that. An appointment schedule for the following Monday, as it was Thursday.  Mid after,  received a couple text from Mike. One link was to a detailed report of the inspection. I Then called. Having had the report to review, took away some of that anxiety I think many get talk to mechanics. Mike was realistic with expectations. Explained severity and priorities. But most of all...he was upfront. He didn’t force me to agree to anything, no guilt; and actually final decision was to do a few things, and retiring this vehicle. That conversation and the first encounter I had; respectful, welcoming, appreciative, realistic with expectations and just nice to deal with. I knew this was a business was one to come back too.

Most Arby's back on the east coast are closing due to the myriad of competition, changing consumer tastes as well as the cost of doing business relative to returns of profit.

The service here was satisfactory and the staff led by the store manager Myreon were helpful and pleasant to engage.

The classic roast beef sandwich was familiar and tasted fresh. The Turkey club with bacon was good and they tried to make it as if you bought the sandwich from your local favorite deli or diner.

The price point is a bit too pricey for the overall value. The sandwiches are on par with pricing given at diners and even more premium fast-food establishments.

102680251419362393306,Steven James,1565929736247,4.0,"So ordered a Big Mac, that was it, and as I get my food I see a promotion that says buy a Big Mac get one for a dollar.

So I asked the manager standing nearby if I could upgrade real fast.
No one told me about the promotion prior to that. She bluntly said all I can do is refund your money and start all over. Which would be fine but she said the refund would not be instant and so now if I wanted the deal I would either have to start all over and wait a week for my refund, or just buy a second Big Mac negating the point in the first place.

I worked in customer service for years, and the manager I spoke to sets the bar fairly low. If I were in here shoes I’d of punched in the discount and just sold me a Big Mac for a dollar and wrote it off a loss.

I’ll be back because the foods always been good when I go.

I understand they were super busy and that she had probably had a long day which is why this is not lower than four stars. But a couple of minutes of her time and a Big Mac, not to mention her honoring the special clearly posted by Mc Donald’s, would have turned this bad review and disgruntled customer into a five star review about how she took the time to make sure I was taken care of even in a fast paced and stressful environment.

Well, good for thought.

The staff is friendly & the facilities are ok. The different spa rooms are interesting. Just keep an open mind when u come to this spa. The one thing I didn't appreciate is I added on 30 mins to my massage & DID NOT get the 90m (pkg had a 60m massage) For The Massage, the therapist used that time up for other stuff. The massage was a typical Asian massage, no focus on anything. I did get a spa package that was 230 that had about 4 things in it so ended up paying 270 with the 30m added. Too much dough for the low quality of service provided. I also had to tell the therapist to do the DT bc she wasn't doing it at first. If u have sensitive skin or are fragile DO NOT get the scrub. It is brutal but ur skin is soft after, also u are completely naked with no cover while getting this done. Modesty, throw it out the window in the this spa. Again keep an open mind.

I took my child in because she was feeling sick and I hear the physician's assistant telling another staff member ""what kind of mother allows her child to get sick this often""  she came in and I told her ""this mother and her prior  pediatrician has tried for years for the insurance to cover the medical treatment that needed to be be done"".  She then said oh so you overheard my conversation, after that she gave me a medication that I told her wouldn't  work I paid my co-pay left.

My child has been on antibiotics for a week still can't swallow water taking it 2 times a day on day 5 call the pediatrician and let them know that the  medications not working, and  I need to make an appointment  for them to change her medication. I was told that I had to pay the co-pay, I let the front desk girl know that unfortunately at this time I'm in between checks right now I can't pay until my next pay day. The girl ar the front desk said well then I guess your childs not being seen. She then proceeded to tell me""have her finish the medication that was prescribed to her and maybe when you have your co-pay will see her"".

Called her original pediatrician on the other side of town got her in the next morning got her the correct medication didn't care that I didnt have the  copay. My child's tonsils were completely swollen and covered in puss,  her throat was almost completely closed tried to call the office manager at the Wee Care Pediatrics and was given to medical records left a message for medical records and said this is not who I asked to be transferred to but please transfer this message over to the office manager I've had no response since.",,"{'time': 1512678219009, 'text': 'Ms. Ferguson, we do apologize for the delayed response but wanted to thoroughly investigate the incident as we take these claims very serious. We are truly saddened that you had a negative experience in our practice. We have spoken to our provider and staff regarding this situation and have been assured that those were not the words spoken or used regarding your child. However, it does not make it acceptable.  We have counseled our employees regarding the entire situation. As far as the medication goes, it is common medical practice to start with a first line antibiotic which is what was done. If there is a documented history of antibiotic resistance, then we can jump right into prescribing a more broad spectrum antibiotic. We want our patients and parents to feel confident and comfortable in our office setting and will use this to ensure that we improve and provide better care for all in the future. We wish you the best and hope that you find a medical home that takes great care of your family.\n\nRespectfully,\nTony Bakerink M.D.\nWee Care Pediatrics Review Board\nMargaret C.

From the beginning of moving in, the staff was rude. My partner was the one paying for the unit since I did not yet have a job, and so they put his card on file for what they said were ""automatic"" payments. Well, it wasn't automatic since they still had to press a button to send the payment through, which did not go through his bank because it is not set up for that type of payment - had they not lied about the payment type, it would have been fine. But since it was manual, the payment did not go through, and only AFTER we were charged with a late fee were we notified of a so-called ""missed payment."" They did not alert us in any way that it was attempted for five days and then we were charged after the fact. When we went in to confront them with this error, we were continuously interrupted by the so-called ""manager"", Alex, and when my partner asked that he not be interrupted, she threatened us with an eviction notice! She continuously rolled her eyes at us and was extremely unprofessional and rude. So, that day I told her to put in a move out request over a month ago, and my partner got an invoice again for $48 even though we were supposed to have a $20 credit on our account and we had requested a move out and have all our stuff moved out before the vacancy date. What an unbelievably awful experience.

December 26, 2016. A Monday. My story begins with my father and I getting down from our car and randomly walk by a guy walking into the building carrying his lunch. His name was Chad and he simply asked us if we needed help and I I obliged, thank fully so. Ford Mustang please... bam! From then on he shows all the nice 2016s dark gray with all black wheels, a yellow one as well and a 2017 grabber blue with regular tires, no tint. I test drove that and off the bat became the nicest, most beautifully crafted machine I have ever driven. It is simply a work of art. And the paint was nice.

Next, Chad works the details with my father and I about my credit conditions, because it's horrible haha, but none-the-less worked truly their hearts out, Chad Wellborn and even his big boss Kevin Vanetta, who's own efforts as well truly made me feel like they wanted to make my very own American dream come true. As Chad, Kevin and everyone else there we're working on getting me that car my dad was telling me of how he used to just dream of a Ford Mustang but now he can't believe we're getting one. He told me he loves Mustangs and he wanted me to get what was displayed at the time right at the show floor, which was a red convertible, 2017. Dark silver rims, it was nice. But I'm not into convertibles. Anyway, that day had to end on the unfortunate side for me. Alone, my credit and present employments just couldn't do it.

So, I got back home to reshuffle and figure out a co-signer who would jump in with me. so I did, by Wednesday night I texted Chad that I'd be making another visit after work with my co-signee and give it another try. The next day, Thursday, apparently Chad already had a car parked at the front, a 2017 Ford Mustang grabber blue, but this time it was with the special 19"" black and chrome wheels, and newly tinted, as dark as allowed. With that candy paint blue the tint fits so perfectly. It was the most beautiful thing I've ever seen. Once again Chad and Kevin work their magic and we came to an agreement. Ended the year with a bang and looked onto the new year with a new job and a new car. It was truly an experience I will never forget. This became my story and all I can do is be forever grateful to everybody in that building. Now I'm just wondering what Filipino food to bring to them, just as a gesture ;) Cheers!",,,0x80c8d11eb3fb673b:0x2392e57cd0864eb7

Today,  on the other hand, only half of the vanilla cone was dipped in chocolate. When we asked if he could fix it, the worker said no. That was as far as they could dip the cone.

I recommend signing up for their email sales flyers. They send out codes that are exclusive for sales. Most of the sales are very good (more than 50%off brand name products). Make sure to save the sales codes you want since they send out sometimes 3-5 separate sales per week and you need that code to get the money off.
I only give 4 not 5 stars because for a tech store they have awful computer systems that look like they are dos based. This impacts customer service and can, at times, make for a miserable experience.
That said, I like shopping there because the deals are that good and I am now used to their sales codes quirks and like I said, I only go there for exactly what I want.

106487124541178517440,Lino Zackary Tenorio,1555271468538,5.0,"I am writing this letter to tell you about my experience at Public Works Coffee Bar. First of all my name is Lino Zackary M. Tenorio and I'm from an Island called Saipan (Few islands from Guam). I was in the Army but got Medical Discharge due to injuries I sustained twice from Iraq getting blown up. I also still work for Washington Traffic Patrol. I am usually using a wheelchair from injuries I've sustained since I moved here to Henderson. I lived like 30-45 min away from Public Works Coffee Bar and I would either take my bicycle, wheelchair or take the bus just to come by and get a coffee regardless if there's a lot more coffee shop closer but I loved going to this wonderful Coffee Bar for so many reasons.

First thing I notice was how I was greeted when I first walked in and an employee came to me quickly to assist me. I've also sticked around to see how the employees treated customers and was surprised how awesome there customer service is and there Super friendly and very welcoming.

All the Staff are awesome, laid back and they treat you with respect or in other words they treat you how they want to be treated and have no problem helping customer such as myself to figure out what's good to drink. All staff employees approach me professionally that I come across are knowledgeable, friendly and accommodating.

As a proud Public Works Coffee Bar customer I want everyone to know about the  employees here who who do their best for customers and that strive to provide outstanding quality, service and value every customer visiting the store. It shows that they're proud to have customers like me in your store. Obviously, all the staff exemplified the standard and I'm happy to be a returning customer. Especially coming across Leeza & Sam who always puts a smile on my face every time I come by. The best part is they have the BEST coffee I've ever tried and will continue to return back regardless if it takes almost 45min on my wheelchair but it's worth it.

I work from home so the bass drives me out of my mind. Kim in the leasing office did nothing but ask me for my unit number. I don't feel safe here, the security guards are useless. Any time it rains there is an ankle-deep lake at the bottom of the stairs. Someone came and stared at it for a few minutes a few weeks ago but nothing's been done. Lastly, there's no change machine and after the washer and dryer steal their quarters it costs a good $4.50 to do a load of laundry and you have to hunt down change all the time. Between the noise, the electric bill from the old AC units, the pool that is a lie, and the leasing office and management company doing nothing, everyone with 1 star ratings is telling the truth.

My father has a cabin here so I think we are supposed to get some kind of local discount but it never pans out which is annoying. We usually buy a family pass for the week which is super reasonable.

I love the basketball court and shooting around before I lift weights.

The warm indoor pool for laps and fooling around with the kids is a great way to get out of a snowbound cabin and get some fun family exercise.

I’m always perplexed at well funded fitness facilities of this size that have a tiny weight area and don’t have barbells. The facility is huge but they cram the hamster wheels and weights into a closet sized area. It’s a 1970’s health club model. The cardio/weight room is the most utilized area but it gets the least space. The entrance lobby is bigger than the gym. It would be nice to get with the times and trends and expand this space to accommodate the demand.",[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPG1egX52UNSc4OC8NT82P3yUXy0kSb8ZBIZfAi=w150-h150-k-no-p']}],,0x80997047a9330493:0x9072589028b8cb44

100827474874645595251,David Sanchez,1506546233731,4.0,"I’ve rented from Alamo 3 times so far this year and have another rental planned in a couple of months, this is my latest experience with Alamo Rent A Car.

I arrived at the Las Vegas Alamo on an extremely busy weekend, the weekend of the I-Heart Radio Music Festival at the T-Mobile Arena the I-Heart Daytime Village Festival across from the Luxor and the Life is Beautiful music festival downtown, were all going on during the weekend I was in Vegas not to mention everything else everyone goes to Vegas for, needless to say the traffic and the crowds were pretty bad.

One of the procedures I like that Alamo offers and I always use is the kiosk check-in, I don’t have to wait in line, I don’t have to go to the counter and talk with a employee, I always reserve my car ahead of time online and bypass all of the other people that wait until they arrive to rent a car. I’ve never had a problem with the kiosk check-in until now. The computer did find my reservation but was unable to finish my transaction due to the very high volume of customers trying to get their rental cars not only from Alamo but from all of the rental car companies at the rental car center in Las Vegas. A “floor attendant” for lack of a better word saw our dilemma with the kiosk and directed us to a side counter (no waiting) since the lines were very long at all of the rental car counters not just Alamo’s. The employee we talked to was very nice an apologetic since even her computer was pretty slow. We were finally able to check in and she said for our problems with the Kiosk she was going to take off some time from our rental that ended up saving us almost $40! They also don’t try to brow beat you into submission to purchase all of the extras and upgrades, in fact she didn’t even ask us to purchase a single thing extra. That’s why I rent from Alamo and will continue to do so as long as I continue to receive this level of customer service.",,,0x89a96c8641a470e1:0xc8320c24bcffd126

102571863212302754607,Patrick Shy,1588966419659,5.0,"I am writing this review based off of my experience with Andrew Webster.

We initially were looking to purchase at champion chevrolet in reno, and upon disagreements with a pushy salesman we left.
THE DRIVE TO CARSON IS WORTH IT.

My family has dealt with, and done business with many car salesman over time.
Andrew was of the utmost professionalism, patience, and care.
He never once pushed me to do anything I wasn't okay with.  He never tried to throw anything more expensive at me. When I asked something he knew the answer, if he didn't he honestly said he was not sure, and then he RAN to get that information. I am very grateful for his time he spent with us. We initially looked at one trim level for a truck, and then decided to step it up a notch.  He wanted to make sure I wanted the second truck before we went any further.  We came in on a Tuesday, and i said I needed to think about things, he simply gave me his card and I left. Two days later I returned, and he met me at the lot on his day off just to show me that second truck.  To make an even longer story short Andrew will not let you down. He is THE MAN.  Andrew, when you read this, thank you again. My son said he made a new friend at the dealership! I would happily reccomend Andrew to anyone who is even remotely considering a different vehicle.

P.s. the finance department does a phenomenal job as well, and Michael hohl motor company will make sure you are taken care of.",,,0x8099a0390a969ec3:0x5c450802f8b5aa86

Unfortunately the haircut i received from Sarah (the second time i have visited this location)  has made me question all premises of the idea of a higher being.

Despite trying giving feedback throughout the haircut  whenever she prompted my opinion all comments were ignored/disregarded as if she had sold the control of her hands to the control of the devil himself.

Trying my best to trust in my stylist i have given the cut a solid week to ""normalize""  with no avail this morning looking in the mirror i fully realized that my haircut looks worse than the natural hair growing on a hairless dog.

""Free Neck Trim""...... No Thank you! I will preserve any remaining self confidence  under a ball cap for the next several weeks  until my hair is long enough to be re-cut.  Even then i fear ill have to try to convince the barber that i attempted a haircut on myself to explain the inconsistencies that will still likely be visible.",,"{'time': 1548959351560, 'text': 'Hello Kacey, Thank you so much for your feedback.

The shrimp is big, but the spaghetti sauce is not delicious
It is much worse than the red sauce in Taiwan. The price is too expensive. I don't recommend this !!!

It ’s an appetizer, but it ’s also a big portion.
Much like cold noodles, lettuce wrap noodles, and the sauce is Thai.

An extra large cheesecake is sweet and greasy, but the whipped cream is not bad
Strawberries are not delicious

There are a lot of people

At that time, a waiter only served non-Asian guests. It didn't feel very good ~
Not very recommended for this dinner (maybe each branch tastes different?)
But you can have a look at cheesecake !! American desserts are so sweet ~

超大一份 起司蛋糕很甜很膩 但鮮奶油還算不錯
草莓不好吃喔 有塑膠口感

人很多 店內燈很昏暗
服務態度很普通 等點餐等很久
當時有位服務生只服務非亞洲的客人 感覺不是很好~
不是很推薦這間的正餐(也許每間分店味道不同?)
但可以吃看看起司蛋糕!!美國的甜點都好甜阿~","[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNbJO5YmwLYwdY4VF3JZtNVRHsMKQInqI9fUusj=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPAUk8IZ9Yd3Tlj1ME2dbpoFQyAR-8b4I3NK4Ur=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPAPA9PicfYKBs6bGu-PvqVPCA83ruV2mkDT54w=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMN251FP031VesmNcHkVDWTMvqokzuD8rpVDxaB=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPc29XDzGgTqz_FZYgXpFedS35s8Pivdd8-vEfK=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMapHrotReHicvBYHc8Ma2koCmnu--NQBVde45e=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]","{'time': 1581635066144, 'text': 'Thank you for your feedback.

I purchased the ""Telefloras Upsy Daisy Deluxe ""  Daisies are my mother's favorite flower so it was perfect! The picture was a yellow vase FULL of yellow and white Daisies very beautiful. In the picture there are no ""extra"" flowers what so ever. When I called it spoke to a very nice woman who I specifically asked, ""it will look like the picture correct? All nice and full of Daisies with no extra flowers correct?"" She informed me that this was correct, that it would look like the picture nice and full of just Daisies. I wish I could post a picture of what my mother received. A FEW Daisies and lots of ""yellow flower filler"" nothing like the picture at all. I didn't say anything to my mother since it was her bday. I decided to call back and see if they would accept a payment for a small bouquet since my bill somehow came out to $65 and was also not informed. Cassie informed me that she could not help and I could have my mom exchange them and did not want to help nor understand. So I just left it alone until my mom calls me today and says, ""Hey, for some reason your flowers are already DYING!!!!!"" So regrettably I have to tell her that they were not even suppose to look like that and I tried to call but the woman did not want to help. My mother then takes them up to the shop and they give her a couple of new Daisies and send her on my way. My mother left sad. This is not a good place to do business with. I try to support local companies and this is how I get treated. Cassie also informed me that I shouldn't base what I'm expecting with the ""photo shopped"" photos on their website. So why have pictures up at all if you can't go by them????? She admitted their pictures DO not look like what you will receive. She got some flowers from the grocery store that are still alive but my $65 flowers are dying after 2 days????? Don't waste your money like I did",,"{'time': 1476315962928, 'text': 'We are of course very sad when someone is unhappy with their arrangements, we wish that we could make everyone happy all the time. While yes, we do have photos on our website provided by Teleflora, flowers are not a manufactured product and it is unreasonable to expect that an arrangement is going to look “exactly” like a photo; we only ever promise that we will get it as close as we can with what is available.  And yes, a $45 arrangement with a $15 delivery fee, plus tax does = $65. Flowers are priced by the stem and because the daisies came in very tight this week, the yellow solidago filler was added to help fill out the arrangement a little more… that was my judgment call, I just thought it looked better, so I apologize.\n\nWhen she called to say she was unhappy, we immediately offered her a replacement but she refused, as she felt we were being unfair because we originally charged for delivery. As for her mother; when she came in, my staff dropped everything straight way to help her and freshened up the arrangement as she requested, she seemed please when she left. As with any order, there is a 72 Hour product guarantee for replacement and if brought into the shop we are happy to freshen it up for up to a week.\n\nWe invite readers to judge for themselves; check out our photo gallery of custom arrangements we have done for other clients, along with testimonials that have been e-mailed to us at www.bumblebeeblooms.com.'}",0x809940ca14d4c01f:0x4ca88f911e070e79

Must be said though that the room was noisy.

They already leave you on hold for an hour Everytime you try to call. Do they even do their job? I hardly think so. All for me to call them one more time today for them to tell me that two days ago, Brinton Theresa declined my request for treatment, and that treatment is not needed, even though she diagnosed me with Hashimoto’s disease and approved it before in March.

104729976442992125566,ankun guo,1579024258244,1.0,"I feel very disappointed to McCarran Hertz and had very unpleasant experience as brlow:

1.Hertz representative made me feel they provide excellent service by helping to fill the gas with the fair market price when return. But at the end they charged $10/gallen if you choose to let them to fill. I feel deceived since at first i felt this is very kind/convinent service that Hertz provides. At that point I felt his might be a reason why Hertz is a leading company in this field.
So I returned the car with about 1/4 gas in the tank. However, as i mentioned before, Hertz charged me 3 times of gas market price. And I need to spend more than $100 that i could avoid.For what the representative told me, I am pretty sure i heard it right.when i repeated it to the representative, he didn'tsay anything. Another proof that i believed what he told me is that when i returned the car, i asked the inspection personnel couple times if Hertz will fill the gas tank with the market gas price.The inspection guy told me that's not true. I was very confused at that time. However, that guy didn't tell me that Hertz will charge 3 times of market gas price by that time. No doubt I received a big surprise after i saw the receipt. But If i didnt have that misleading information in my mind, there is no reason why i didnt fill up the gas before return since i had plenty of time to catch the flight (more than 2 hours). Unfortunately, i choosed to trust Hertz. On the other hand, this is my 1st time to return a car with empty tank since i believed in their service. All cars i rented before i always return the car with gas full.

My point is that even though no one has the obligation to tell me these 'traps', but i feel if Hertz is a company with positive or healthy culture like many other companies, It's not hard to give the customers a warning about the high gas price if they help to fill the gas. It's also not hard to tell customers there are bunches of hidden fees upfront which is the 2nd reason why im not satisfied with this car rental. Unfortunately, Vegas airport Hertz choosed to deceive the customers and kept earning these filthy money,as we all know, Las Vegas visitors!!!

2, hidden fees.
Dispite that 20% tax that customers having no choice, there are also about 20% hidden fees that Hertze should let customers know upfront. Otherwise, customer may feel the quote they get includes all services/fees. This also proved that Hertz is not an honest company !

3, when i got my car, the cigarette port is not functional since i need to plug in my converter to charge our cellphones which is important for the long trip to other places. When i reported this issue to the customer service, i was told that the company only rent a car and this is not an issue as long as the car is drivable. What the hell...?This sounds like it's ok to have the microwave/lamp/faucet broken as long as you have a bed to sleep in a hotel. This is not acceptable!

Overall, the experience with Hertz sucks, im pretty sure this is one time business. I will definitely not recommend Hertz to anybody. But if you want to choose Hertz, be careful!",,"{'time': 1579703256875, 'text': ""Hello, thank you for taking the time to review your experience with us.

We service thousands of vehicles every year and this is not normal for us.  I can assure you that I am not happy with the end result either.  I spoke with the General Manager about your situation and he refunded your money for the damage to your vehicle. The technician that serviced your vehicle is very experienced but had some difficulty with the low profile tires which caused the chips to the wheels.  In hindsight, he should have advised you that we were not able to handle the mounting process with our equipment before he began.  Some tire and rim combinations require a touch-less tire mounting machine.  We service many different vehicles from old to new, family cars to performance cars, and I am confident our technician was not not joyriding your vehicle, but merely performed a routine road test to ensure the wheels were balanced before returning it to you.  We would never service a vehicle that a client did not authorize us to operate on public roads.  It is part of the paperwork you sign during the check-in process.  Either way, I wish we had the opportunity to rewind and start over again.  Thank you for your candid review, which will help us provide better service in the future.'}",0x80c8c63115c2ebed:0xcee14401004da698

I arrived to NU Car Rentals and they rented out the Jeep that I had prepaid to reserve. AND on top of that, they charged me an extra $40 for 3 days so that I could drive off in a vehicle, and (Jason) literally smiled as he did so, even though I was CLEARLY getting upset. He tried to give me a Nissan Versa, which is not even close to comparison for the price of a Jeep! Customer service is definitely not their strong suit! I have called to speak with a manager and I’ve been told twice now that I will be called back when one becomes “handy” as they put it. This location is not in the same location as all the other rental car companies and is in a location that looks like a mechanics house. This business is sketch and I would avoid putting your money at risk! UPDATE: I just received an email with these photos they had taken upon the return of the vehicle. Clearly they are a scam of a rental car company because for one thing, that mark was there in a previous photo. As well as if they were actually a reputable company, minor knicks and scratches they would not charge you for! BEWARE of these SCAMMERS and take your money elsewhere!!!!

It’s clear he loves his place of work, which must mean he works under great ownership. A great asset to a business during these ever changing times in the industry.

He also did not charge me anything since this was still covered by the earlier warranty!!

We explained we wanted a used vehicle, had a vehicle to trade in with negative equity, told our credit score, how much month payment we could afford etc. We get there and have to wait a half hour to see who we spoke to, were shown cars we did not want to buy and that were new instead if used, then they show us a payment DOUBLE of what we said we could pay.. It was a complete waste of time and I do not understand why ford country even has an internet sales manager if they will not figure out finances and if your situation is workable over the phone! Not at all pleased. 😒

Review part 2:
I called Jose the very next day and he told us he would call us back Tuesday because the banks weren't open Saturday. I still have not received a call from him.

I instantly called the hotel to tell them what happened and the lady that answered the phone for customer service took all my information and not until then did she tell me that it was an outside company! She pulled out the information and needed to read it and couldnt find the name of the shuttle company??? She assured me that she was sending an email to front desk with all the information and they would contact me on my cell with the shuttle name.  Meanwhile I instantly start googling shuttles and calling to see who drives for the trump?? Found the shuttle company and she immediately dispatched him and he met my husband outside the gate.  Mind you 1 1/2 days later I get a voicemail that they contacted shuttle and no cell phone was turned in! REALLY AND JUST DISMISS THE SITUATION!! Poor communication and customer service on the Trumps part.  How do you offer your customers a service and your employees not have the correct information to give customers? Very dissatisfied .

However, they definitely skipped out on the rooms. The rooms are very small and look extremely dated.

I could hear my neighbors opening the blinds in the room next to me and what they were watching on tv. If you do stay here because of budget reasons, do yourself a favor and request NOT to be on the floor with all red rooms. When I say red rooms, I mean RED. Everything is red.

110681682513022225641,Alese M-C,1596056425939,5.0,"Amazing orthodontic care ✔️
Incredibly kind doctor and staff ✔️
Beautiful aesthetic office environment ✔️

Needless to say, we have absolutely loved our experience with Art of Braces! A year ago our pediatric dentist gave us a heads-up that our daughter had a crossbite, a very small mouth and a good deal of crowding and that we'd want to schedule a consultation with an orthodontist for early orthodontic intervention.
We then scheduled a consultation with Art of Braces and a few other (very popular) orthodontists in town. After attending all the consultations we knew that Art of Braces was the place for us.

Not only is Dr. Benson is incredibly knowledgeable but she is so kind. She answers any questions that we have, she takes her time with her patients and she has never talked ""down"" to either my daughter or I.
While other orthodontists in town jumped right into recommending thousands of dollars worth of ""round one"" braces, Dr. Benson was forthright and said that she believed my young daughter's current orthodontic needs could be solved with an expander (and one set of braces a few years in the future.) She was right. My daughter's crossbite and crowding are no longer an issue. She's now has room for her adult teeth to grow in and has a centered (though currently half toothless 😉) smile.

Dr. Benson's staff is also fantastic! You can tell that Januari, the office manager, knows what she's doing. She is helpful, kind and answered allllll of our consultation questions!

Allison, the scheduling coordinator, is just so stinking nice and easy to work with! (I want to be her friend.)

Marlou, who has been our orthodontic assistant at almost every appointment, is incredible!! She sent my daughter a letter after her final expander check with encouragement from the tooth fairy - I mean how sweet is that?!

On to the office environment.

I can't tell you how much I appreciate the aesthetic experience of The Art of Braces. Dr. Benson is not only a orthodontist but also a fantastic photographer. The Art of Braces is basically an art gallery with orthodontic equipment in it. Truly. There are hug glass landscape photos on every wall. You just feel like you can take a deep breath when you walk inside. (With your mask on, of course, because we're still living in 2020 😉). Her photography is absolutely stunning.

On the note of coronavirus - The Art of Braces has gone above and beyond to keep the patients and staff safe during this pandemic. I am incredibly grateful for the detail and standard of care that they display. I feel safe in their office, and we can't say that about most places right now.

I know that this may be a drawback for some but it was really a selling point for us - other orthodontists entice kids to their offices with ""prizes"" and incentives and video games in the lobby...The Art of Braces doesn't do that, but it's because they don't have to. I feel like their office offers an excape from consumerism and a chance for all patients to simply be present. (But they do have snacks that you can grab on the way out ❤️). My daughter doesn't need to feel the pressure of ""competing"" for a prize or the temporary ""high"" of ""winning"" a ""reward"" and can simply appreciate the fact that her teeth are being cared for.
Quality and minimalism are very important to me and The Art of Braces is a place where that is beautifully reflected and mirrored to my daughter.

All of that to say - we are so grateful to have found The Art of Braces and would 10/10 recommended Dr. Benson and her staff for all your orthodontic needs! 🦷✨",,"{'time': 1596056362411, 'text': ""Wow, that is definitely one of the nicest reviews we have ever received and it means so much to us!

We were in town and purchased the bottle of pictured CBD oil. $60.00. When we got to the airport to leave town I opened the box so my husband could use it for his back before the flight. We were more than shocked to find that the bottle had never been filled. Totally empty and dry. When we got home I tried emailing multiple times - no response. I called and spoke to an employee who said the manager, Nick, would call me back after I explained. It never happened. I assume this isn't their fault, but they should at least pretend to make an effort at customer service here, and they have failed on multiple fronts. We paid $60 and received nothing for it. I hope, for future customers, they will at least notify the bottler of this product. As a warning to future customers, please check any bottle before you leave the premises so that this does not happen to you.

One of my best friends tells me all the time how good this place is and I'm happy to say I agree. The portion was much more than I needed but it was all so delicious I nearly ate all of it. The eggs were perfect, the crispy potatoes were great (they aren't hash browns. The waitress told us they don't carry hash browns), the biscuit was huge and they did give me strawberry jam so I don't know what the person below means about no jelly.

The only problem we encountered why my boyfriend's bacon was a little dry but as soon as he told the waitress, she came right back out with new bacon and he said it was perfect.

Speaking of the waitress, she was wonderful. i believe her name was Heather if the management happens to read this. She answered  my questions and explained everything in great detail so I really knew what my options were. She had a great demeanor and was probably the best waitress/waiter I had in Vegas.

I will definitely be returning on my next trip. And being 24 hours is a huge plus!",,,0x80c8c43c0ab262c1:0x3bfda9a276346b48

They have the actual courtroom and furniture from decades ago.  The condition is incredible.  A wall of Mobsters that I found amazed had so many from NJ.  Well done and very informative.

This Midas location fixed my wife’s fuel pump issue today. Oh let me tell u about how the Midas shop in Washington state first did the replacement and when we head to Phoenix while on vacation my wife truck does with no power. Had vehicle towed to The TRUTH MIDAS at 365 Nellis Blvd who respects veterans from all branches of service and this  home shop makes u feel very welcome unlike Washington state Midas. Thanks to the whole shop at 365 Nellis Blvd in Las Vegas. Also, I would recommend to all my friend that this is the real honest truthful place to get service done right. This shop really lives up to their slogan/ motto. Shout Out again to the whole Midas Nellis Shop and BART I will see u in TX hopefully for the Rodeo and Trail Rides.

The room stunk so bad we rushed to open window. That didn't help, especially with the triple digit heat. After several calls to management, and another trip downstairs, we were moved to another room. Smelled better, but AC was working. It took 8 hours and 2 fans from maintenance to bring temp down to 78. That said, the room was dusty when we wiped things off. The sheets were stained. The food choices were ok. The pool was small, but built for handicap access, which was great. Also, we inquire about reserving a cabana. We were told the price, then advised they were already booked. We spent the day by the pool, and there was a vacant cabana the whole day. Guess they were saving it for someone special.
I certainly was no longer impressed with the hotel. There was no non-smoking gaming. I doubt I will be back.",,"{'time': 1504046166590, 'text': 'Thank you for taking the time to review the Golden Nugget Laughlin.

Came here for dinner one night with a buddy of mine and we ordered a bunch of stuff to share. The restaurant was empty at 6pm, the staff were very nice, seated us right away and took out drink orders. The pork belly $10 was very tasty and seasoned well, the sea bass was overlooked not here fresh and very chewy which is unusual. The short ribs were very good also. I ordered the stone bowl bibimbap $12 and it was not good at all, the ground beef was very greasy and the rice was too soft and didn't have any crunch like it should, the flavor was a bit off too.

Service was very attentive, prices are rather high for small portions. Floor was not very clean. Parking was easy.",,,0x80c8c1d90151ce11:0xdbfe531776230fe0

The staff making the sliders were slow. so slow yet it was the afternoon, with only 2 customers including myself waiting for their order and it still managed to take nearly five minutes. It was painful to.watch them in the open kitchen, slowly assembling the sliders one.at.a.time.

The young man calling out the order numbers for Pick Up was rude and as I was his last customer for the day managed to swear loud enough announcing to his team that I was his last F***** customer of the day.

The tables were sticky and dirty and the sliders were a complete and utter waste of chewing.

Not to be fooled by the pictures you see of the 'Grey' reception hall/the lobby put up. That thing is really dingy and smells horrible. Service is terrible. You will have to wait in the queue at the reception in the evenings before its your turn to talk to the receptionist - this wait time can be as high as 1 hour, yep. I have put up as many pics of this dirty place as I could. Beds are just not cleaned, stagnant water in the tub, cockroaches etc etc. And mind you, the parking place can accommodate like 10 vehicles. Beyond which you have to park in the street, at your own risk, and this street parking is payed parking after 9AM until night- btw, free on Sundays. Again, I know its cheap, but check this - there are 8 beds in a room = 8*20avrg = 160/day. They why the hell is this place so dirty. Once in, your clothes catch that weird smell, and you smell the same all throughout the day. Just avoid this place is my strong suggestion.

You will not be treated like a number here. At Mountain West Chiropractic you'll receive outstanding, individualized treatment and well you'll notice that you're a person, not a number.

When you go to Mountain West on Pecos, you will experience the ultimate in chiropractic healthcare. They provide cutting edge treatment and really work with you you achieve your individualized goals.

We presented to Dr. Bahoora with some very difficult medical issues a and he reached out and set up a highly individualized treatment program to help us reach our goals. Both myself and my daughter have worked with Dr. Bahoora to improve our spine health. I had lingering, long term issues from a auto accident in 2012, and she has severe scoliosis. He helped us with a program designed to help improve the curve of her spine and we are both working to avoid surgery in the future.

Dr. Bahoora is one of the few doctors trained in biomechanics. I believe we will be successful based on the positive results we continue to see, and his entire offices care and the interest they've taken in helping us succeed in overcoming our spine health issues.

I had somewhat of an emergency come up and needed to get into a dentist as soon as possible and Dr. Swanson took time away from his personal time off and attended to my needs immediately.  Not only did he open his office just to see me, he welcomed me with genuine kindness and care.  His communication with his patients is astounding as he is very clear and consice when he discusses everything that needs to be done, as well as how and why he is going to do it.  This high level of communication with his patients allows them to understand the care they are receiving as well as understand proper care for their teeth after leaving the appointment.

I had a procedure done which was my first serious issue with my teeth and the work Dr. Swanson did was fantastic.  Not only did Dr. do incredible work on my tooth, he sent me home with a full understanding of what to expect as well as how to care for it.  One of the things that impressed me the most was that he personally reached out two separate times in the following weeks to make sure I was healing properly and that I didn't have any questions.  In today's world and health care setting, I feel that often times communication between patients and their Drs can become somewhat compromised for many different reasons.  Dr. Swanson's care, communication, and compassion should be what all physicians in any speciality strive to have.",,"{'time': 1572396954519, 'text': ""Thank you for such a nice compliment!

repeatedly so I stopped by the dealer, they
they topped it off and sent me on my way,
then it happened again and I said this car is too new for these issues I went to the dealer again and the receptionist told me very coldly that I needed to wait 20 minutes to get it topped off for the second time, which is frustrating considering this is a 90,000 vehicle but fortunately I bypassed the receptionist and the
service tech topped my coolant off again assuring me it was nothing for the 2nd time
this was a different service tech, then again
goes the coolant light and to get it fixed
the date was like 2 weeks out to service it,
So then my 3rd visit I bring it in they had it
3 or 4 days I leave and the windows are so spotted that I couldn’t see out the window, and I was literally afraid I was going to get in a wreck
Then the next morning goes the coolant light again, arrrg!! So back to the dealer again but needed to wait a few to squeeze me in, then the 20 min they told me it would take turned into 45-60, I think all totaled I went there 5 times.

112591063676969573930,Matthew Sampson,1535618181900,1.0,"Edit: Unfortunately this review needs to be amended.  I purchased a second vehicle that I brought here for a prepurchase inspection.  While it didn't receive a glowing report it wasn't recommended to not be purchased.  Went ahead with the sale, and it was a complete nightmare.

The vehicle spent more time at Frank's than it did in my garage for the first 3-4 months with recurring issues over, and over again.  Many thousands of dollars later issues such as the check engine light were finally solved 12-13k all told including the purchase price.  The suspension is still a mess even though part of that amount included suspension work. I of course anticipated some work needing to be done (as is necessary in any used car purchase) however that was just the tip of the iceberg.

The nail in the coffin was my mother mistakenly asked for a tune up instead of an oil change on the Mercedes (see original review below) at the garage I used to go to back East which was extremely reputable.  I pay for all her car repairs etc.  So at first this was just an annoyance since I had this done at Frank's prior to driving it back East to her.  For the tune up, and 2 new tires the total cost was 1/3 of just the tune up I paid for at Frank's.

This brought to light the serious breach of ethics I had unwittingly been experiencing in the 4 years of patronage at Frank's.  I'm not mechanically inclined, and trusted them.  They were always friendly, and even with the constant headaches of the 2nd vehicle I enjoyed my interactions with the staff.  Unfortunately my trust, and many many recommendations of my extensive casino network of friends wasn't enough to insure a fair price on repairs.  I have without a doubt spent my last cent at this establishment, and any outstanding warranties on work done previously wouldn't entice me to return.  I have advised anyone I previously recommended to avoid the establishment as well.  Either the car never in a million years should have passed the prepurchase inspection I had them perform, or they knew there were many issues that would need be paid for to get it into acceptable condition.  What the truth was who knows.  What I do know for sure is I have experienced a complete loss of confidence in the garage.

Original review:

I bought a 98 Mercedes in 2013.  I had the vast majority of maintanence, upgrades, and oil changes done here up until August when I drove the car clear across the country to give it to my mother. A year later she is still driving it without any major issues. Frank's employees are very professional.  It is always busy, and can take a bit to have work done although that is a good sign that people come here that often.  It is not an easy task to find an honest repair shop, and when you do it is a good feeling.",,"{'time': 1475079302085, 'text': ""Revised reply: We do not tell people what car to purchase, or not to - you brought a 2003 Infiniti with 150,000 miles, everything that was done was discovered during the pre purchase inspection, some items required testing - this may be a lesson when looking to purchase an old car with many many miles. I would have preferred an opportunity to speak to you - We stand behind everything we do. Industry best 3 year, 36,000 mile warranty. Thank you Matthew for the trust you have placed in us!

Heard about this place by pure accident when sharing a Lyft.

SOLD. 2 people, 2 strangers loving a pizza place can't be wrong. And they weren't! We were staying at the Bellagio and the Cosmopolitan (where it's based) was right night door, perfect to grab a couple of slices. The pizza was amazing, can't believe I didn't take a photo.

They were both very patient with me. Cassie made sure that I was relaxed and comfortable and then Dr. Chung took over and had the area completely numb. I
wasn't feeling a thing... I would say it was painless! If I had to do it all over again, I would definitely return to Aliante Dental for their kindness and patience with my dental concerns....Amy, Cassandra, Nisa and Quisha are the best...Thank you Aliante Dental 🙂

We wanted some good food and a nice place to take a break for an hour.  I googled restaurants in the Winnemucca area and the Pizzeria came up with the best ratings.  As soon as we walked in I could see why.

Parking was easy and this place was clean and well cared for.  We were greeted right away by a friendly young lady named Melissa.  She was warm and welcoming, and brought our drink orders right away.  (Good beer selection, too)  We were a little unsure of what to order because everything sounded so good.  Melissa made some recommendations and we ordered.  The food was amazing and fresh!  We enjoyed the fresh, house salad and loved the garlic chips and the garlic / jalapenos they came with.  Had a chicken and jalapeno pizza to top it off.  Everything was delicious, and the inspirational signs on the walls were an added bonus.

I'd go on a regular basis, if it were not 10 hours from home!  But it's nice to know that if we ever drive through Winnemucca again there's a terrific little place to eat.",,,0x80a0e34ad8343f31:0xffa4961c8456c0f7

My wife ordered The Superman chicken sandwich which had FRESH Guacamole ( I MEAN FRESH GUAC), Swiss cheese and a BBQ buttermilk ranch sauce to die for. The regular fries were OK, very thin but perfect so you do not get full off fries. The sweet potato criss cust fries were the better choice and of course washed it all down with DP!

Well, I found it here with Tammy D. She is so hard-working, friendly, funny, and extremely professional. I started getting hybrid lashes since I have so many lashes and sometimes classic lashes can look a little sparse since there are like a thousand lashes to lash and I am 110% satisfied with the hybrid recommendation!! It’s been more than a week and literally no fall out.

**Believe your stylist when they say that your body/lashes go through a “shedding” season. I didn’t understand that at first and did not properly care for my lashes the first time I got them done and it really showed (totally my fault and no one else’s 🤦🏼‍♀️) This time around I am cleaning my lashes every other day with the cleaning solution/brush sold at the Lounge and OMG huge difference!!!! If you’re on the fence about buying this, definitely invest in it to make your lashes last longer and keep them more hydrated and less weighed down by all those eye gunkies we all accumulate.
Another thing to get that actually works is the sealant that you put on after you clean them to strengthen/reinforce the bond of the lash extension to your natural lash. This has really decreased my fall out. It’s seriously magic!!!

Anyways, long story short... give this place a try and ask for “Tammy D” and treat yo’self!!! Thanks Tammy ❤️❤️❤️",,"{'time': 1609177008724, 'text': 'Great review Maureen!

Music, instructor, painting experience and the game they played, spinning the wheel for prizes, what a nice idea. There is one thing that I did not like and that was the temperature inside was terribly cold,  I had asked 3 times to please turn it down cause I get cold easily and my fingers get purple and then they turned numb because it felt like the temperature was actually getting colder. So it was hard to paint towards the end. I know it was not just me that was cold because I brought my daughter and grand daughter and they both were extremely cold. I actually brought a sweater but could not wear it because when I got there I put my sweater over the seat and the paint was sticking out to the edge of table and so my sweater got red paint on it so I had to try to wash it out so I could not wear it.",,,0x80c8d0e7ef9996df:0x7000f45411edee1e

When renting, there is no indication that this place is actually 5 miles from the rest of the car rental places and that you have to take ANOTHER shuttle. Upon arrival, it took over 45 minutes to process just the people who were on our shuttle! This place is by far the slowest and least efficient car rental company I've ever experienced. Then the guy said we would be driving a Jetta and sent us out to go get our car. There wasn't even a car in the spot he said to go! And no VW's in sight! After wandering around for a few minutes we finally found someone who told us to take any car in a given row (pretty common). We settled for a Camry, which performed fine for us. Return was also a hassle, since you have to go back inside to that SAME horrid line to get your final paperwork instead of having them print it car-side like every other place!

Color of my skin should not factor into any decision made by an owner but sadly in 2020 this was the case. In good faith I’d expect this realtor to not do business with an owner like that... Once you pay the $50 application fee it’s like you’re a nobody to them and their loyalty is with the owner. Left me scrambling to find a place as I was approved then later denied so I had passed up other opportunities.,,"{'time': 1616444440435, 'text': 'Hi Camery,\nThank you for taking the time to leave your feedback. I apologize for the frustrating experience you had and wanted to reach out directly as the owner. First, I’d like to clarify that Housing Helpers of Las Vegas does business in accordance with the federal fair housing law. It is prohibited to discriminate against any person because of race. Not only is it against the law, but on a more personal level, it is simply wrong. That is not an accurate portrayal of how we conduct business nor how we treat our clients.\n\nI’ve talked to all the parties involved in order to investigate your complaint and can confirm that the reason your application was denied was not due to the reason you have stated above. Rather, the owner accepted your application because you met all the qualifications, but after you were accepted you added another tenant who did not meet the qualifications (listed in writing on the application from prior to applying). Qualifications are what the owner decides and only based on income, rental history, and credit.\n\nThis is something we take very seriously and I would kindly ask you to consider revising your review because it is an inaccurate description of our company values and standards. That said, I’d like to again apologize for the poor experience you had and any miscommunication involved. You were a great applicant and a pleasure to work with. Our team is here to be a resource for you moving forward should you ever like to get in touch, feel free to reach me directly on my cell phone at: 941-875-4723\n\nWe are happy to hear you found a home.'}",0x80c8c5a822ae611f:0xfa17c1900384d6b2

105721480336850189497,4eva AVCS,1582776763365,5.0,"When we were looking for a wedding venue we relied heavily on reviews from other couples. Having a destination wedding isn’t as hard as it seems when you have an amazing team of people that go above and beyond to make this a memorable experience.

With so many options to choose from in Las Vegas, we had narrowed down our choices to three different venues. Ultimately we ended up choosing Mandalay Bay because of their customer service. Unlike many other places in Las Vegas, Mandalay Bay was prompt in answering any questions that we had and made us feel valued.

Having our wedding at Mandalay Bay Las Vegas was one of the best experiences ever. Our wedding planner, Emily Thomas, was extremely helpful in turning our vision into reality. We basically just explained to her what we wanted and she made it happen. Emily was easy to communicate with and was always available to answer any of our questions whether it be via phone call or email. She was quick to respond to any and all questions we had, and let us know ahead of time when she would be out of the office or unavailable.

Mandalay Bay Weddings made it easy for us to have our own minister. Although our minister was not licensed in the State of Nevada, Mandalay Bay was very accommodating and had their minister sign the paperwork and allowed our minister to perform the ceremony. Because we had our own minister, we did have to pay for a rehearsal. However, the rehearsal is extremely important so that everyone knows the cues and make sure the actual wedding day flows smoothly.

Photographs and videos last a lifetime. When planning our wedding, we knew from the beginning that we wanted to spend the extra money on a photographer and videographer to capture our special day. Cashman Photo works with Mandalay Bay Weddings. We were nervous that we were not able to choose our own photographer and videographer for the wedding but Cashman Photo did not disappoint. Karolynn McMurray from Cashman Photo communicated well with us from setting up our photo viewing appointment to purchasing our photos.

On the day of our wedding, our photographer, Ken, and our videographer, Ariel, from Cashman Photo were so fun to work with! Ken was an amazing photographer. He made sure to capture our true essence and not make us feel like we were posing uncomfortably. Ken is a really creative photographer and really utilized the scenery to capture amazing photos. He was also very accommodating to the types of photos that we wanted; for example: we wanted first look photos, photos with our parents, and even a big group photo with all of our guests.

During our appointment to view our photos, Karolynn McMurray was awesome. She allowed us to view a slideshow of all of our photos, thoroughly explained all the package options, and informed us of any discounts that were available at that time.

Overall, Mandalay Bay Weddings has many options and upgrades to choose from which makes it a great choice for any budget. For couples like us that aren’t from Las Vegas, the website that Mandalay Bay Wedding creates for you, allows you to choose everything from the color of your flowers, to choosing music for your wedding, and even upgrading the aisle runner and arch. We are happy to have chose Mandalay Bay. They listen to your wants and needs and turn your vision into reality while making sure that you feel valued. We would definitely recommend to anyone wanting to have their wedding in Las Vegas.",,,0x80c8c5cffb824261:0x6d27bcd49aeb882f

Finaly I got somewhere, I am finally in a room and all it took was someone who was there to do their job and not complain about wanting to go home or checking in people and not even bother to take the urine from the patient.

For me the Center offers a smile, some inciteful knowlege and services I cant get from Medicare. They have programs for all age groups.

And they have good options to help you thru anything. Look them up if everything is closing in on you. You're not alone. There IS someone that cares. They were there when I took my first medical trip out of the country because no one would help in the states. They have always been available when trouble found me.

I had to leave for Vegas very late because I had an event that night. I arrived very early , about 3or 4am with my husband and 4 month old child. Hours before I called the palms place customer service and explained that I would be traveling very early with an infant and would like to know if early check in was an option for us. I also let the customer service person know that I would be arriving by 3 or 4am and she told me to check with the desk when I arrive and was very rude. If I would have known that their earliest check in was at 12pm, I would have done things differently. Basically, I get there and they say that I can’t check in until 3pm. The lady at the desk never even told me about checking in at 12pm even though I asked. So I ended up paying for a room to stay in for the time we arrived until 11am (a waste of money but I wasn’t going to have my infant sitting in the lobby until 3pm)and had to go back to the front desk to switch keys because we were just going to stay in the same room for our actual reservation time. And that’s when I found out about early check in at 12pm from one of the guys at the front desk.

Actual review of the room:

Besides that, the room was nice,besides a few stains on the wall. The floor was very quiet , no real complaint about the room. I just wish my experience was better coming in.",,,0x80c8c695ff74de6f:0x4d4cfb9123991be7

There were so many different lanyards on the website it was overwhelming as I knew what I wanted but wasn't sure where that would be with so many choices  on the website.  I decided to go to the physical location to ensure I was ordering what I wanted.  Nathen took the time to sit down with me and go on the website to show me options of what I was looking for.  He explained to me in detail how I needed to place order ect... followed up with me from start to finish via email and phone calls.  I received the order on time which so important. The quality and the colors were excellent!  I was very happy with the order!!   I had used another company before I looked this one up on google, it took over 4 months to receive and absolutely no response to emails or phone calls when I would inquire about my order not being shipped as promised. Not even close to the date it was to be ready!  I was so frustrated with this company is to why I reached out to Alphagraphics.  I would most defiantly use this company again in the future and will recommend this company to others 100%!  Other companies could use more people like Nathen!  Communication!

105233406572574799004,Paul Wilkinson,1399374152267,4.0,"Went here fairly early on a friday evening which is ""gourmet night"" luckily there were no similarities to the Fawlty Towers episode. This meant it was a couple of dollars more expensive but there was a selection of caviar to try in addition to the usual food selection. The timing also meant there was basically no queue.

Smoked salmon and tuna sushi to start as well as plenty of crab. Food on the whole was pretty good, nice beef wellington, good rack of lamb both well cooked. Some bits like the salmon fillets were a bit overdone and the pork belly was a bit dry but overall it was good and the sides were varied and nice too. Huge selection of desserts showing a wide range of pastry skills.

Service was ok, would probably have been best to tip when the first round of (included) soft drinks were brought out to ensure a steady flow. Plates were generally cleared fairly quickly too.

It's a great buffet, but it's not going to beat any of the good a-la-carte choices but I thought it was pretty good value for money at $40 for 3 courses and soft drinks.",,,0x80c8c43264352b09:0x9bd97c6084012c93

Smells like old cooking oil, and A LOT of oil is used in everything. I would have appreciated some healthy options on the menu.
I ordered tempura vegetables...soaked and dripping in oil, I peeled off all the batter. Steamed veggies would have been excellent.
The side salad, being just typical, was the freshest item on the menu, so I ordered 2!
Then, the cap on the pepper shaker fell into my salad as well as half the pepper.

Overall, the food was mediocre at best.
Service was good.
Fun watching the chef cook our dinners.
But, our group enjoyed visiting and spending time together.

Him and his office staff were so kind, welcoming, and listened attentively to my questions and concerns. Throughout a long process of needing to repeatedly move my surgery date, they were patient, accommodating and truly became like family. After extensive research, I had chosen Dr. Alexander because of his emphasis on a natural look, which is what I wanted from my breast augmentation. He takes his patients' pre-op condition very seriously, so be prepared to make a doctor's visit and have blood work done. Him, his staff, and the staff at the surgery center were relentless in their attention to detail and followed up with me extensively to ensure I was healing well.  I am now 3 months post-op and blissfully happy with my results.

Lowdermilk,1545770862106,5.0,"We came to Las Vegas, for the first time, and were looking for The Grove on Swenson St., a dispensary which was too busy so we decided to leave. On our way back to the car we saw the Double Down Saloon, reportedly the ""Happiest Bar On Earth"", (according to the painted sign on the building), and having seen this bar in an episode of Anthony Bourdain's food network show, decided to venture in seeking refuge from the heat. I peeked at my phone and saw a message from my aunt telling of the sad news about Bourdain's death. How bazaar was it to learn of his death while accidentally in the same bar he visited during that show we'd seen??? Still gives me goosebumps!!!

Funny enough, after showing up two hours late and taking all day for a simple swap, the recirc pump was never done. We let our property manager know and Desert Air was sent out begrudgingly. They wanted us to wait even though the recirc pump was actively leaking and causing damage. After who knows what was done we were told they needed to order parts. Now anyone who is in the industry knows that that is a fallacy and most often code for we need to get authorization. It took nearly two weeks before we would receive a call and get on schedule. The appointment was schedule for 2/9 with an 8:30-9:30 arrival. Well it is now 2:22 pm and no one has still shown up to my house. When I called at 12:28 pm no one knew what was going on and I was asked to be called back and when I got a call back from June she told me that the tech couldn't find my parts but had found them and would be there within an hour. I've worked in the industry for years, and have had several companies come to my house since I moved in, and I have never seen the lack of customer service that I have seen since having to work with this company.

ETA: A simple phone call from the CSR, dispatcher, or technician would have alleviated everything. My son missed an entire day of school waiting for someone to show up. No one showed up until nearly 3:00pm. Our dispatcher would have been in constant contact with our customer letting them know what was going on. If necessary rescheduling until the parts could be found. We understand that vendors lose parts or give the wrong ones. We understand that sometimes that sometimes they are broken when they are picked up. We understand that you may have to go to multiple places because one place says they have it only to not have it when you show up and you’re left scrambling to find it at another place. We understand that covid has made it harder to get parts. We experience it all the time. Your tech can tell you we work for a competing company. We know the expectations and that things come up. Again, all we asked for was communication. That would have prevented all of this.",,"{'time': 1612914451789, 'text': ""Thank you for taking your time out of your busy day to post a feedback on google.

Fast forward to 2021 we received the work order  from Issac in regard to a leak in your home, We promptly came to your residence and assessed the situation and proceeded to get the authorization and order the parts. Once the vendor called us to let us know the parts had arrived at their location we called to schedule the appointment , unfortunately the vendor could not find the parts when we arrived to pick them up , we apologize for not communicating with you on that unfortunate situation as we were trying to get the parts into the office so that we could perform the repairs needed today.

There are none better in the courtroom. There's a extremely small amount of lawyers that have won criminal cases in federal court but Thomas has done that multiple times. That is extremely elite company. If you're a physician or other healthcare professional and find yourself as a target in a federal investigation then call them immediately. These types of cases are complex and difficult and go on for years. Believe me I know Thom has stood by my side and gotten me through it. He's awesome and I highly recommend him and his staff.

The atmosphere was pleasant, unfortunately the same can't be said for the food. I've enjoyed frozen Italian dishes from the grocery store for $6 more than the $70 meal my husband & I had. The chicken fettuccine alfredo was soupy, the chicken was weird little cubes. Hubby's raviolis were gamey & gross. Even the calamari was rubbery, served only with steaming hot marinara. The salad was delicious. Typically I'd give a restaurant a chance to redeem themselves before posting a negative review, but when it's so blatantly obvious that your food has been cooked completely in the microwave, it would be pointless since nobody in that kitchen possessed any culinary skills.

It was expensive to have the roots removed",,"{'time': 1467808628659, 'text': ""Miscommunication indeed.  Unfortunately we really missed each other when in our discussions about the removal and replacement I thought I had made it quite clear that we were only grinding the stump below grade and that there would be large buttress roots or some of the core still in that location.  I had recommended moving the planting site away several feet so there would only be smaller roots for the installers to deal with, we ALWAYS recommend planting in a new hole and not in the same hole.  We never 'dig out the roots' as that would triple the cost, we stump grind to remove the unsightly stump and yet be cost effective but warn people that there will be root mass or stump underground, thus we always recommend moving to another planting site and letting the decomposition of the roots take place naturally and feed the new tree.\n\nI regret that Dwight felt that we were somehow to blame for his installers not knowing to reset the location or misunderstanding my warnings, but I tried to save him money and the agreement clearly states 'stump grinding'.  Had we been commissioned to dig it out it would have been much more expensive so perhaps he saved money on that end using the installers to do that digging work (to explain: my guys are paid climbers wages and the insurance on them is 10x what it is for landscapers, so, for them to be paid to dig around in the dirt my cost would be double, therefore it probably cost a lot less to have the professional diggers do the root removal)\n\nAgain, sorry for the miscommunication, let me know if I can be of any further service.""}",0x80c8c4a9cfba6c15:0x4aa8d734c2662179

By that time my other parts arrived but went over their 30 day return policy, I then was tired of waiting and proceeded with my build come to find out the shop would not install that $900+ part. I then intiated a return and found out there was a 33% restocking fee and I ate the $50 shipping costs, the item was still brand new in the box and never installed or taken out of the box!!! Now I am out $335 and STILL no exhaust and at that time I asked for a refund on the exhaust due to mixed reviews and tired of waiting.

This place is great! I tried both the chicken and beef tacos and found them to be perfectly seasoned and unbelievably fresh tasting.

Clean, bright, and a great atmosphere. I am really pleased that this place is not just another clone type restaurant that is the same boring place and has the same boring food everywhere you go.

Don't let the location or appearance put you off this place is great. I was a little scared to go here when a friend  recommended me this place since its not located in the best area in town and looks a little run down but this place was great. My friends dog had a really bad corneal laceration she basically poked a hole on the surface of her eye with her nail. We took her to VCA to get an estimate. VCA had us waiting with an appointment for over 3 hours and the doctor didn't really explain it to us in a way we could understand. To top it all off he said he said she would have to lose the eye and gave us an estimate of between $1000 and $1400.

We were recommended this place to get a second opinion boy am I glad I listened. We checked in and waited we were called into the exam room where a really friendly older nurse explained what was wrong with her and why it happened and how to prevent it from happening again in a very clear and understandable manner. The doctor said the same thing and told us the eye did not need to be removed. It was salvageable she just wouldn't have complete sight in the injured eye. The estimate was under $400 and that included some of her out of date vaccines. This place does get packed and it seems they don't do appointment so its a walking sign in type of thing so do expects long waits when crowded. Another great thing is their vaccines are really affordable I used to think the animal foundation had the cheapest prices but this place beats it parvo and rabies are around $6 each on Fridays, Saturdays, and Sundays. Call for exact pricing I don't remember exact details. If its a surgical procedure I definitely recommend you give this place a try.",,,0x80c8c2bff7a89011:0x3867fe5ecabfb606

Peek : 1) plan the time to visit according to calendar and weather. Summer is too hot, while winter is again chilly. 2) you can have a day trip from Vegas, it’s about 2.5 hrs drive.

The night sky is something that you should not miss. 3) be prepared with your food and drink, there are not much things available inside. 4) always enter with your gas tank filled.

Other Amenities: The included shuttle to the strip was convenient and punctual. Although we did not have regular housekeeping services (we stayed less than a week), our request for supplies was handled promptly. If we had come during warmer weather, we would have loved to spend time at the beautiful pool. The location was also fantastic - we had easy airport access and were able to walk to pick up a rental car from McCarran airport.","[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOAJb9Rtow-TAhZC0yffq3EJI57GfjMyv8pMKUW=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPVUonEe238EJwB5JhN8LhyN-L1mXkwmqVouwEE=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMik7bLkI7qX4BbL6S2SgfMzDTuFfzz4wkYV7ww=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]","{'time': 1581442774931, 'text': 'Hello Julia!\nThank you for your comments and reviews!\nWe are so glad to know that you liked the resort and loved all of the amenities that we have to offer!

And a doc that was close and had on-site lab stat etc..My previous primary has these so I knew there has to be more out there. It's rare u find all the things I wanted because it's rare to find also a doc who does almost everything without being shipped out to another doc for gynecology etc...there's two women docs I've been seen by both and there very dedicated no rushing takes the time to listen explain everything etc....It's almost a one stop doc. And if that's not enough they also are called what's the word quick care/urgent care. So people who have appts. come first and walk in's get worked in.  I love the docs however every time I've come in the receptionists aren't really very kind or even smile. Just like anything,anyone,and anyplace first impressions are important . So this morning I had to reschedule my appt. Due to my car breaking down. She was not nice I told her if I could have called yesterday and reschedule I would have however yesterday was Sunday. Still very rude. However on the doc and nurse side they are wonderful .
The nurse just called to give me referral info for ortho surgeon I explained why I did not want that place she was more than happy to call back with a different place to go to . And so because she was awesome and docs amazing they are my 1st impression  only reason I don't give 5 stars is cause nobody is perfect Including me so consider 4 stars the best!!!!!!",,,0x80c8e9f46be1c331:0x63b398f3606313f4

I ordered the lamb and it was cooked perfectly, however, it wasn't seasoned. My girlfriend ordered the filet, and that was the most disappointing part of the dinner. It wasn't cooked evenly throughout and the texture suffered because of this. Everyone has off nights, and that may have been the case for Bricks on the night we dined.",,,0x80994096d9b53775:0x73cc7ab50c904ec

Customer service is really really poor & bad. It's true what they say about this place. She doesn't seems to care when I told her about the reviews.

BJ was always very responsive and positive throughout the process.   In the end we settled on a number that I was happy with.  I pre-qualified for the financing on line then jumped on the next flight  to Vegas.  BJ had a car waiting for me at the airport to shuttle me to the dealership (very nice touch).   I signed the deal and drove home in my new Range Rover!  By far one of the most pleasant car buying experiences I've had.  Everyone at the dealership was friendly and helpful.

GBNP is located in one of the darkest locations of the US, just west of the Utah/Nevada border. Known as ""class 1"" skies, it doesn't get any better than this. Though it was cloudy at sunset, I napped a bit and got up at 11:30 to find mostly clear skies. I shot for a bit with no tracker - just 25 second exposures and camera settings to record as much detail as possible. Amazing skies, amazing place. Wheeler Peak is so peaceful and quiet - it's a wonderful place to recharge the mental batteries.","[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNm0TZMad5I-EX4NuGC9DChbz3BUdms2d5p8keG=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO_USnRzjvMv8uxVXDjPl0Jf_4FMszxfkqG--Rv=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]",,0x80b167b0ec1e147d:0x3f9beba95705447c

I'm done shopping at Petco and PetSmart, not only does this store have competitive pricing but they have nothing but the best products on their shelves.  Not to mention their pricing on treats rawhides and toys no retailer or online business can pass the cost savings down to the customer like this place does!  DI almost forgot to mention...they have a bakery on-site and make birthday cakes too! That's just the beginning!!!  A DIY full service to customized wash stations with ramps and a separate grooming facility with friendly on-site groomers.

On a personal experience Jeremiah and Christie introduced us to Gradma Lucy's freeze dried products to replace the big expensive bags of Simply Nourish small bite adult dog food, I learned about this organic natural bio friendly food and it's nutritial value and how it supports all stages of a dogs life, let me just add my three pugs and puppy boxer love it!  A 14lb equivalent bag of this food is a little bigger than a 1gal freezer sized zip lock bag, makes our long distance trips so much easier to pack the doggiebag!  Also, they introduced us to a 96% bio friendly natural organic and super healthy canned protein blend of wet food and I'm already seeing the results!  Sorry about the rant but I almost forgot about the new body harness Jeremiah and Christie introduced us for our puppy boxer, omgooodness this new harness has completely stoppdd my dog from pulling and he recipricates with eye contact and auto corrects his negative behavior!

I am furrrrever loyal to your establishment and look forward to returning and learning something new on our next vist!  Thank you Wag N Wash for your help and keep up the excellent work!  You folks rock!!!  :)",,,0x80c8c78b691d8f8f:0x69d72771636b61a1

I spoke to Alissa, and thought I was asking for the impossible- wedding being in less than a week. She was happily up to the challenge, and found a couple of options. My mom actually found a dress that worked beautifully, and they helped to accessorize it. The entire crew was friendly, professional, and very upbeat. Alissa was funny, patient, quick, and very helpful.

Thanks for the help, everybody. I'm not normally too girly, but you helped me look and feel like a princess!

Here is what happened, first of all I bought my 2015 Yukon used from a used car dealer, I still have 22100 miles on it and the factory warrantee should still be valid.  I took some much valuable time off from work to go camping and wouldn't you know it, after I pull the trailer from the storage lot, my check engine light comes on at 3PM and we are planning on leaving early the next morning.  So I brought it to the Earnhardt at about 4PM, this is the closest place to where I live, and the service guy told me it would be later in the evening the next before he could even get it on diagnostics to find out what was wrong.  Of course I was upset but I do understand that I am not the only person in this town and there are plenty of other people wanting their vehicles fixed.  I went home and told the family that the camping trip will have to be postponed but they understood that it was totally out of our hands.  The next morning at about 9:30AM I received a call from the same service agent and he told me that he was able to get the truck in earlier and found the problem was the fuel pump.  He said it should be ready by 4PM, at that time we promptly called the camp ground back and was able to get the reservation again.  At 3PM I received a call again from the dealer saying the Yukon was ready to be picked up.  I got the truck at 3:30PM, hooked up the trailer and we were gone by 4:15PM.  Awesome

Bottom line, when you vehicle fails you, it is not the dealers fault and they are truly doing their best to accommodate everyone that comes through the door.  The service specialist that dealt with me was very professional, very empathetic and truly made an impression to me to the point that when we are prepared to purchase the next vehicle, most likely a full sized heavy duty pick-up I will purchase from this dealer.

All I can say is thank you, Thank You, THANK YOU!!!! For saving a family trip and making my 11 year old daughter very happy!",,,0x80c8eb5076facaa3:0x4260c3ed9850229f

112828455244746111861,Alizen,1606818206719,5.0,"As an LA native, I really try to avoid hitting up local spots that end up opening businesses in Vegas but I was looking for a better, cheaper brunch option than the selection in the Wynn/Encore hotel so we found ourselves ordering here.

For starters, it's super easy to just order via the hotel phone or online so it's ready for pick up by the time you get there. You do have the option of charging it back to the room so I always choose this method whenever possible.

LASAGNA ($15.95) -- comes with your choice of bread (sourdough) and a salad with vinaigrette dressing. I honestly think that if I had just ordered this for the two of us, we would have been totally fine. But of course, it had been a while since we last dined at Urth so I forgot the portion size was much bigger. This is a veggie lasagna, for those inquiring minds, and all the while worth it.

QUESADILLA ($12.95) -- comes with a small bit of salad, guacamole, side of black beans, and salsa. Kind of confused as to why the sour cream was missing but I would skip on this one since I could have made a better one at home. Props for the guacamole and beans for being absolutely delicious though.

OREO CHEESECAKE ($10) -- not for the faint of heart! I mean really, you're gonna need like 3 people to finish this but D A M N is it delicious (and it sure as heck better be for $10 a pop).

The decor of the restaurant matches the beauty of the Wynn resort. I'm glad they added this to their selection and do see myself coming back soon!","[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNzYt2-Xl7ZnW9zTDIetX3E7fS-C0GR2uS-9A4X=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM6Q_kX45n_Ku35b91-nWqHKhTguPFa3xHzC1I0=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMg-9O6ch2Lue_5ek6-S8im__zVT0-PDm8bIS2N=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOHtXIk_tDwZsN3TQmxMd0yrdKVgBdfQtaP41Ce=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMiciY3sz2_VMrHNGmdqqlLSTvDUgWJWklu9a-C=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNkFqdLXV7Af_7VgXkVtKPQiPXJH26vTW2KczZ7=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM9RI-LyYBvNYl0dBLus4yqNL-y7fI_0owDcnXB=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMCOCfWK2azcRjS6-nwv-sQ5n9-TNY4jGuJc1Ov=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMSJV7bWvS_iam7aap92FrrzmQc-nqSybKCanAK=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN1aSZHnDdK69I-rrTSHUbvJrTYLyL6Jm12ibTv=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOHWAqWKHgiuM4y6Wx7VX7VuxAjAecsMuKvgEg7=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]",,0x80c8c5ccf73cc4f3:0x1848f0ebadd4fc1c

Spoke to the cashier and let her know if she could not give me 30% off, I'd like my things held until I could retrieve them after work the following day.  I told her that would be about 6:30 p.m.  She said holding them would depend on when a certain individual came in and then they would be placed back on the racks.  She would not leave a note and seem VERY UNcustomer oriented unlike any other experience I've EVER had at Kohl's in my LONG association with.  The disorganization and unkept-ness of the store was an eye opener.  Management of THIS store SHOULD BE re-evaluated!  I plan on calling this morning to customer service to ask them to hold my merchandise until I can get there to pick it.  It was an unusually disappointing shopping experience and I WILL NOT EVER SHOP AT THIS LOCATION AGAIN....after retrieving my stuff IF they even held it for me.

The accident happened on a Tuesday morning, but their earliest appointment wasn't until Friday. It wasn't a problem, I had a rental car, and was able to leave it at work (it was not safe to drive it). On Friday I slowly drove to Gerber, which was only 3miles a way, but scary nonetheless. While giving the technician my keys, he asked how I was getting back to my rental car, I said I was going to walk, he said no that's not necessary, and contacted the rental company to see if they could pick me up and take me back to work. In 5 minutes I was picked up and driven back to work. They explained every step of the repair, and kept me updated. My car was ready a day before I even expected. My car feels like new again, I am completely satisfied, and definitely recommend Gerber Collision!",,"{'time': 1575384605293, 'text': ""Rhiannon,\n\nWe're so glad that you are safe after your accident and driving your vehicle to Gerber!

Literally one artichoke heart on each slice of pizza and almost no spinach. All around they had a friendly staff but that doesn't make up for the horrible food quality.

Another server dropped our drinks But we didn’t even receive napkins. Once we were able to get our servers attention and ask for napkins it took another 5 minutes. We were not able to place a food order and finally decided it wasn’t worth trying to get servers attention to place a food order.

Went on a Sunday morning around 9am took 5 minutes to order in drive thru 2 large hot extra cream one extra sugar one with splenda.

I know I asked for extra cream but coffee should not have been that cold. $6.00 down drain. The next time my husband went back he told manager what happened didn't seem like he cared.

104647770253293458215,Pam Boling,1487783543514,2.0,"I purchased a sofa and loveseat from La-Z-Boy on January 11. When they arrived on January 14, the sofa was damaged. One end would not recline at all, and there were large gaps between the segments. The delivery person said we had two options: either have a technician come to our home, or they could take the sofa with them and have it repaired.

Since the only option was repair, versus replacement of a damaged brand new sofa, we opted to keep it so that we would at least have seats available while waiting to schedule the repair. The technician came on January 18. The metal underneath was bent. He said that was causing both the misalignment of the segments as well as causing the unit to be inoperable. His remedy was to order a replacement mechanism, which will be shipped to my home, then I have to call again to schedule another repair appointment.

I told him that I prefer a new sofa rather than a damaged/repaired one. He advised me to call the La-Z-Boy Service Center to tell them, because ""a little push from you"" might be more effective. I called the Service Center and was told that warranty only offers repair, that ""once you sign for it in your home,"" the only thing they can do is repair it.

What I could get is anything from well done/ burnt to rare (nearly cause me to give it 3 stars for the price point). Now, because it is all you can eat, and the flavors are delicious I just wait for it to come around again or just get something else. Now, when I mentioned this to the servers they said even they know it's an issue and the cooks struggle to keep the meat from getting dry and over cooked if you come late or close to closing, just a warning. Honestly, I would just ditch the strip and the hassle parking with so many spots blocked off for the ""free"" valet, your expected to tip and I'm cheap and just want to park my own car.

Since last year, Palomino has changed from an amazing strip club to a real brothel.  Yes, a brothel!

There used to be nice girls with good conversations great entertainers but now... it's mostly prostitution.

Most if not all Cubans girl at the palomino are prostitues. They recruit their clients while in the club. They try to make you have sex, coming to your hotel room for 1000$ and if you say no, they still try to get you into what they call Fantasy room and finish you directly in the club! Camera or not, they say they have their way to do so.

They will insist a lot if you refuse. If you are interested in such practice, these are few names i remember that will enjoy having sex with you ( those are stage name I guess ) : Rosario, Alice... I had more than 10 Cubans offering me sex against money!

I used to love the Palomino for its relaxing atmosphere and its girl selection, but now it feels that you aren’t here for entertainment anymore you are just being harassed.

I reminded him that my claims were still being filed under my old number, even though I had asked if the old ins. info could be deleted. He yelled about having to do my knee shots in 3 weeks rather than his preferred SIX week schedule. (6 weeks = $140 more in copays for me, plus an extra 6 hours of driving thru traffic). I stated the three times I’d had the gel shots from the Orthopedic & Spine Center, they were done 3 weeks in a row, and six weeks was a hardship for me, but he made it clear he was not happy that he changed the shot schedule and said that was why my insurance wouldn’t pay. I reminded him again that insurance won’t pay claims to invalid claim numbers. Then, despite our past discussions regarding starting me on Orencia, he told me to find a new doctor because he had tried everything with me. He did not say good-bye, wish me well, or suggest another doctor. He left. Despite my requests for my records, none have been sent to my new doctor. He also quit on a friend of mine who had been seeing him as well. I believe he has anger issues. I believe he wants no questioning of his ideas. I believe he is unprofessional but can be charming when he likes you. If he doesn’t like you, you are dead to him.

106930781612038573822,Scott Wells,1507566259765,5.0,"After several years of searching for the right shop and artist; on 7 Sept 2017, I found the right place and people. Upon entering Club Tattoo, Planet Hollywood, Las Vegas, I noticed the shop was very clean and the staff were courteous, friendly, and quick to greet anyone that walked in; that’s a rarity in a lot of places today and speaks well of the management.
I spoke two different artists about what I had in mind, and rather than attempt a piece that neither were comfortable with, they were not too proud to point out another artist. That speaks volumes in regards to the personal integrity of these artists.
Meeting with and looking through Tim Lees’ portfolio, and discussing size, placement, and design confirmed that he was the artist for the job. Tim was able to free-hand sketch, and tattoo the perfect design with zero flaws. His dedication, determination, and meticulous attention to detail brought to life 25 years of military service. Tim’s own patriotism and love of this country shines through in this stunning work of art. The art work I proudly wear bears an American flag, slightly battered with scars of war, and a Spartan helmet, marred as well. The words “Molan Labe” in Greek at the bottom does not just represent an idea of weaponry; rather, all freedoms, which I have, and still will, stand and fight for.
This piece is not just about me, it represents our warriors, past, present, and future; Tim’s artistry and passion for perfection allows for a life time of reflection and represents to all who see it, how passionately I feel about my country. I now have a much deeper appreciation as to why these people are called tattoo artists; as the piece Tim produced can truly be called a work of art.
For anyone in search of the perfect place and artist to create their own masterpiece, your quest is over. I gave this shop 5 stars, only because I cannot give them a higher rating.

First, we had a reservation, and we were seated on a couch.  After mentioning we had planned to eat dinner, we were told 30 minute wait for table.  Not sure why we made a reservation.

We decided to make the best of it, and decided to start with drinks and appetizers while waiting on table.  Drinks took nearly 30 minutes, and we were about 2 minutes from leaving.

We ordered chicken tacos, they brought shrimp.  10 minutes later they brought the tacos, still shrimp.  We just ate them.  Food was okay, however steak came out cold.  Took them 10+ minutes just to warm it up.  Came back not cold, but not hot.

Server did his best to cope with issues not his doing.  He comped an app and a dessert.

Considering prices, no excuse for all these issues.  Can't imagine we will ever return.",,,0x80c8c5e283a75415:0x704fca8eac1b7869

One is the  woman who drew my blood took her mask down to speak to me and was in very close in proximity to me when she did so. I felt that was extremely unprofessional and it made me uncomfortable given COVID statistics in Nevada. I had no way of knowing if she had been vaccinated or not. I have been very diligent in not compromising my health by staying home and away from people who don’t respect masks as much as possible. Her callousness was very upsetting in a healthcare environment .  The second was encountering  a woman in the lobby area with no mask at all that was less than a foot from me. She was accompanied by a staff member of the hospital.

The doctor and nurses who performed my contrast imaging where very warm and professional. I had an MRI performed on my right hip. I have an allergy to contrast imaging and I felt very well cared for and informed by staff from pretreatment and throughout my procedures.

The position I had to hold for the MRI  was very painful due to my hip and lower back issues. I had involuntary movement ( muscle spasms). I was in so much pain I was weeping during the procedure. I’m not sure if there’s any way to have had lower back / under knee support during the procedure but if that were possible I could have held the position better. Or perhaps taken a muscle relaxer prior to the procedure to help prevent pain and involuntary movement.

All of the fighters at the gym are always more than willing to help any person learn a technique, spar, or just overall assist in getting better.  Everyone is incredibly friendly, and not one of the fighters at Rick's gym carries themselves with an ego, or puts on airs.  Also Rick is in charge of Ultimate Reno Combat, an absolute top notch promotion for any amateur fighter.  As a manager and promoter, Rick is as straightforward and as honest as they come.  He never hesitates to put his fighters best interests first.

The workouts at the Reno Academy of Combat are very intense.  There is a focus on going 'live' to learn how to think and operate under fight conditions.  There is a lot of drilling as well to help teach proper form and technique and to help learn moves properly.,  Newcomers may feel like they were suddenly thrown into the 'deep end' with this style, but  after only a week or two you will spot a difference in your endurance and technique.  As long as you have the commitment, and keep attending classes you will get better.

Reno Academy of Combat is a first class operation run by an individual who truly cares about his fighters.  It is a clean gym, with top notch trainers, and filled with good people who are always willing ot help a newcomer because they remember what it is like to be new.  If you have ever wanted to try Mixed Martial Arts, I cannot encourage you strongly enough to attend the Reno Academy of Combat.",,,0x80993f68150478b7:0x248f97790ce84c64

I'm glad they did!

The office here is very new and modern looking, and all the equipment they use too.  Always a good thing to see when you walk into any medical office!  Everyone was helpful and kind front staff to back.  I was taken care of by Dr. Velayo.  I was thinking I needed a routine cleaning, but from years of neglect, I left with a couple other simple procedures performed to get me back up to speed with my dental health.  She was great explaining the processes and costs involved, and with the treatments she performed.

I left feeling a lot cleaner and more so glad that I at least took the first step toward getting my dental health back.  If you're like me and just need some motivation to get back on track, stop in and check them out!",,,0x80c8ce2b64110547:0x37966ba724d506a0

I wound up driving up and down Las Vegas boulevard trying to figure out how to get to the Mandalay Bay Events Center Parking Garage, which was how it was listed on my e-ticket. It turns out, however, that the street signs say nothing more than 'self parking'. Without any references to self parking for which of the many buildings in the area besides Mandalay Bay.

My e-ticket said I could purchase a parking pass in advance for $12. That is true if you park for less than 4 hours. If you park for more than 4 hours it's $15. It didn't say that in the e-ticket.

Directions for how to get into the event center from the parking garage are non-existent. I wound up wandering around inside the casino and finally ended up following other people going to my event. Once I figured out where it was, then it was no problem. But the first time you're walking from the parking garage to the event center be prepared for no signs, no directions, nothing.

102160184759650277756,Gano Wetherby,1560792851973,4.0,I’ve edited this review after having the job completed by Shawn who was excellent. Overall the service was very good once you get an appointment. The initial call to make an appointment and get a quote was horrible and I recommend the company hires additional phone staff to handle the high volume of calls they receive. I really want to give a five star but I just can’t since the initial contact was so hard. I thought the price was very responsible in fact I would have had no problem paying 35% more which I think would more than cover additional phone staff.,[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPzSubRgEx93oqO54K-_fUtMttlMC1TiDtNPPwo=w150-h150-k-no-p']}],"{'time': 1560364583335, 'text': ""We are sorry to hear that you are dissatisfied!

Whether it's to-go or eat-in, every Italian dish tastes homemade. You can even taste the freshness of the pasta. Very ample portions of authentic delicious italian food, with great friendly service from Lindra. You can't ask for anything more.
Caution: there is another Lino's wannabe using a similar logo & menu. Don't be seducted, they aren't the real deal.
The Lino's Pizza & Italian Cuizine you want is in the Tenaya Village 2, at 7240 Azure @ No. Tenaya Way, linospizzalasvegas.com.

No one else was in line. The manager finally turns to a employee and says see what that girl is trying to get out of us now. I said excuse me and they both ignored her comment.

I found out later on that they are NADCA Certified and that made me even more confident of the choice that I made of the air duct cleaning companies that I found. When they came I was informed of the procedures used to clean my air ducts and then they proceeded to do their job. I was treated professionally from the initial phone call to them doing the job and when they left I can tell that there was a lot less duct around the house, making it easier to breath. Hence, I like being home more now then before I had this service done.

But, the main reason why I have such a low rating is because of the lady who works at night with glasses. She wears a black vest with her uniform. She was very rude and unwilling to serve us. I asked if I could have a side of sauce to go with our leftovers and she rolled her eyes at me as if I could not see her. A lot of my friends refuse to dine in mainly because of her. I guess if we don't speak their language they have the right to treat us like garbage. If you eat there at night, that's exactly what will happen. On top of that, they hassle you to tip them if you don't. Even if the service was terrible.

It started with Frank coming to my home to present me a quote and the details of his proposed solar installation.  His presentation was very thorough and he answered all my questions.  As an engineer myself I was appreciative of all the technical details he provided.  I did speak with several vendors during the section part of my process and I always felt more comfortable with Frank and Solup.  The install went quick and easy as Grady, Jeovanni, Kerry, and Andrew finished a day sooner than I was originally told.  The install team was very friendly and professional and answered all my questions.  Now that NVEnergy has finally allowed my system to be turned on I could not be happier.

There was a mixup with my address so the first tech ended up in Henderson when I live in northwest. They did remedy that right away and still were able to get a tech out to me that same day. The tech told me the regular cleaning wouldn’t get out the stain so he needed to go to level 2 which would cost more - $228. I agreed. He was very nice and professional. He told me to let the carpet dry and the stain should be less noticeable or nearly gone. Guaranteed 90% change. After a day of letting it dry, the stain is still quite noticeable. Lighter than it was but definitely not 90%. Which is why I rated only 3 stars. I did call and they are coming back out to assess in a couple days and I will re-rate after that.

Omletes are made to order. There was a line of able 5 people. The chef makes 5-6 at a time. The wait wasn't terrible. Poke bowls are also made to order. I didn't try it, but it looked appealing. We will visit again.",,,0x80c8c430e90de7cf:0xd24e4322ae07f232
