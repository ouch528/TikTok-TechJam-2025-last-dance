Google Local Reviews Analysis with DistilBERT


📌 Project Overview

This project explores patterns in Google Local Reviews using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. Our analysis focuses on uncovering insights that can inform platform strategies across five key stakeholder groups:

Users (General Audience): Ease of content creation, engagement, community building, accessibility, and data privacy.

Creators: Monetization opportunities, recognition, and growth support.

Businesses & Advertisers: Product promotion, e-commerce integration, brand safety, and advertising analytics.

Platform & Technology: AI-driven personalization, new content formats, scalability, and performance.

Regulators & Society: Compliance, transparency, and social responsibility.

By leveraging the dataset of millions of user-generated reviews (Google Local Reviews dataset
), we aim to identify factors that enhance user engagement, content creation, business promotion, and trust on digital platforms.
