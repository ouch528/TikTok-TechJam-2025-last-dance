I wanted to have some soup because it was too cold. The host told me, yea Hot and Sour soup is available, I can order. I love the soup, so I went in and was seated by the host. The waiter Martha came in, very rude, she acted like doesn't want to serve me. She asked me what to drink. I wanted to have water. Then, she brought the water and just told me to keep looking the menu, until I serve other guests. Even though, I was already ready. I tried to tell her, but she completely ignored me, and left. Later when she came back, I told her I wanted to have Hot and Sour soup. The waiter Martha goes, it's not available, nothing available from Chinese by 12 am. The waiter Martha said that only five minutes are remaining till 12 am. I tried to explain her that I talked to the host. The host is the one who explained everything. She was like I am telling you that nothing from Chinese is available after 12 am, and it's only five minutes left from 12 am and we don't have any Chinese. The waiter Martha placed a hand on the menu on one side and stated you can look after these pages. The waiter literally placed her palm very loudly on one side of the menu and stated, do not look back behind these pages. She said, she's the waiter and she knows What's available and what is not. Then waiter Martha said I have to assist other guests, you keep looking up the menu going forward from these pages. Again, with loudly placed her palm on the menu, and she left to assist others. I was very upset with the insult, and just left the restaurant. This waiter's attitude is like the one who works on the street serving food. I don't think even food serving on a street even does like that. This waiter Martha should not be working big restaurant.

There was still crumbs on the floor from who ever stayed there before, the room features were really old, beds uncomfortable, pillows hard as a rock!

Brought my husband and two year old here, ordered a pizza, and then waited an hour and a half for our pizza. Our waitress came by half hour into our wait and said, we'll have your pizza right out. She didn't come by again. Literally saw a couple come in after us, have a leisurely drink at the bar, order food about 20 minutes after us, got their food for themselves and another couple they met up with, eat and pay. My husband asked the waitress at the cash at this point when our pizza was coming. She looked over at me and my toddler like she completely forgot we were there. She acted like no big deal, and disappeared. At this point an hour had gone by since we ordered. About 8:15 my toddler started tantruming, she was starving and it was about her bed time. I told my husband let's go, and I stood up and packed up. I waved her down. I asked if they forgot our order. She got cold and told me it was simply missed. I told her this is ridiculous, we've been waiting over an hour, the people behind us have ordered and eaten. I said forget it, we're going. She said are you sure? It's really almost done. I said how much longer? She told me two minutes. I said I'm really angry, I don't think this is worth it. She assured us it would be out in 2 minutes. 10 minutes later she hadn't returned and was nowhere to be seen. We walked out without our pizza, none of us having eaten, at 8:25. We left cash for my husband's beer, but we shouldn't have had to pay for any of this. Seriously the most terrible service. At least apologize if you miss an order for an hour and a half and certainly don't lie about it and pretend it's coming.

I explained that we are planning on upgrading our tank as our fish need, but No. Talked to the manager she was a little better but really defensive. I ended up getting the fish I wanted after all that hassle. Wish the employees didn't act like customers are out to try to murder the fish.

I live on the other side of boulder highway next to the Wildfire, the trail leads all the way to gibson rd. If you can handle the journey take the hike, because when you get there, the AC hits you, the smell of bud in the air, smiles from the receptionist makes you feel welcome then the walk through the door and it feels like entering heaven, the shelves stocked with various kinds of bud from flower to concentrates, prerolls for those who don't have the time or skill to roll, edibles of different delights. Budtenders always helpful for those who are new to bud or those used to the old ways of buying ganja. Loyalty points is ok, got my first grinder I still have to this day from it. I recommend Space ghost OG, if available. No credit or debit cards, but ATMs available with a fee to use. Those with Medical Cards have their own line and more selections, but selections are still great with Recreational. Bowls, bongs, joint wraps, joint filters, wicks, etc are available. For those with culinary skill can buy Baker Batches, to make your own edibles. Not for smoking, was wondering why an ounce was very cheap LOL. For those into dabs, as I said there are concentrates, also wax, and shatter. There are also weed pens, and those capsule thingies for them for your vape or pen. Ask a budtender for more information on that. Tax are meh, make sure you ask for the receipt first, tendency to put in the bag and seal it. For those with social anxiety like myself, it can be pretty nerve wracking for first timers, I recommend CBD to calm nerves or to stop a bad acid trip. Military discount is available check the website for more information. In summary a great place for Henderson Locals, must be 21+, great bud selection, budtenders are of great assistance. If problems arise, they will assist you to their best abilities. Also preordering is available, that can be a hassle. For those walk the railroad trail best of luck, I can no longer do it anymore.

They have always been helpful, and courteous. And they are INCREDIBLY bust so decent service suffers these days because of many factors, but busy is defiantly a prelude to crappy service. The only complaint I have has happend at least three times in the 10 months I have been dealing w/them. My frustrating insurance has started to require I use mail order on most of my meds as of late. I have called for a refill/ or brought in a new RX of med, and come back a few days later for it. Only to be told that my insurance requires mail order. It would have been Better to receive a text/or call regarding this. OrI have come to pick up more than one refill and told that pharmacy could not fill it because insurance wants mail order.

Celebrated our wedding anniversary and it was the best time. The interior is wild but in the best way possible. So many textures and finishes, I was in love. The cutlery was cute and plates were mismatched. Our cocktails were tasty. We had a gin and rum one where it came in a round flask like presentation and was essentially worth 2 cocktails. The music was lively and the performers were entertaining and inclusive of the diners. There were lovely jazz singers, a very young and talented breakdancer, and a tap performer. Performances every 20 min or so, so we could focus on our meal selves. Timing war done very well. The staff, every single person, was courteous and professional. Dirty plates and utensils were replaced without us requesting. We were checked in on. Dishes were explained as they were set down. We were asked politely whenever a plate was cleared. The food! Yum!! Herb biscuits were easy and fresh. Shrimp cocktail had a fun lime foam...it was very refreshing though I am a purist and love cocktail sauce with my cocktail shrimp. Crab Louie was excellent...lots going on but all very well together. Short rib stroganoff was EXCELLENT: Tender and hefty cut of meat, super tasty sauce and mushrooms and fun little sheet of semolina. We had the roasted chicken with pesto which was not a favorite but we appreciated the tenderness of it... (The other main courses sounded heavy to accompany everything else we were having and I don't eat fish). To end we had the coconut Panna cotta with pineapple sherbet...while the chocolate terranium was an impressive presentation, we opted for lighter and it was a winner. So refreshing and the coconut was not overwhelming at all. I definitely ending on this note. Overall everything was beautifully presented, flavors were harmonized and nothing was overly salted or cooked. The vibe is trendy but mature...not trendy and douchey obnoxious which unfortunately can be a lot of Vegas establishments. It is seldom I have zero complaints and very high praise.

The bff's Baby Birds salad was gorgeous to look at and was delish in taste. Their avocado toast was fantastic: The generous piece of toast came out warm, the poached egg yolk was on point, and they were extremely generous with spinach side salad that accompanied the toast. Carrots, tomatoes, edible flowers, radishes, etc are used to enhance the healthiness and prettiness of their dishes. They really take the time to prep your dish for maximum taste as well as visually appealing. Each dish is edible art in motion. Very impressive.

She then explained she was going to charge 20 extra for no key. with no reasonable explanation to why she needed to charge me I refused and used a different tow company.

I was adamant about the adjoining rooms and was assured that the notes were placed and the rooms reserved. Upon check-in, they assigned rooms on different floors. When I brought up my reservation, I was told they were booked and didn't have it available as requested. I was offered an option that wasn't as requested which didn't work. Upon check-out, I expressed frustration and inquired why they did not have our reserved rooms, to which I was told they had to fix pipes in the room. I asked for a manager and was told a manger would call in 15 minutes. About 2 hours later the manager called and I missed the call. He left a message stating that reservations don't guarantee a room, that all rooms are first come first serve and offered that io our next stay here would ensure that we get what we reserved. I called him back, left a message stating that ""first come first served regardless of reservations"" is illogical and misleading when offering reservations and I requested a call back.

He literally spent 30 seconds looking at it and then said it wouldn't be covered by the warranty and that it would be around 2000 dollars to fix because the leak was coming from further down the line and they would have to dig up a bunch of the front yard. After he left I took a cup and emptied out the box in the front yard. Much to my surprise they leak was right there at the meter. I called back and they said the tech would come back out later that day. He never showed up. I called back that afternoon to find they close early on Saturdays and I was out of luck. I had no choice but to call another company who showed up and fixed the leak in under an hour and did not charge anywhere near 2000 dollars shockingly enough.

102245926556094702834,Eva M,2018-11-29 05:40:00,1.0,"I had my Escalade ESV in for a factory recall appointment. Since then I've had several informative calls from Zach about trading in to take advantage of upgrades & incentives. He called again today about their 72mo/0% on 2018-2019 Escalades. Ok, I schedule an appointment. Zach wasn't a salesperson so I meet with Tina & tell her what I like & that I NEED 2 bench seats, instead of captains chairs like my current model. She tells us that's really difficult to find because it's not a common option, usually only special order for companies, etc. She kept going out & coming back, saying she was doing one thing or another. We're just trying to see a truck, not talking numbers yet. Finally, she comes back & takes us outside to Sergio (her manager) & they show us 3 models, all the same, black with bench seats. Sergio tells us a casino ordered them then backed out & that's the ONLY reason they had any with bench seats. They weren't comparable to the options on my Escalade so I asked about 2019 options. Tina states the 0% offer was only for 2018 Escalades. Sergio then adds that we would also lose the inclusive maintenance option. I asked repeatedly because Zach had specifically called about the 72mo/0% option for 2018 & 2019 Escalades. Tina tells me, ""I need to listen to Sergio & not Zach because he doesn't know what he's talking about."" So we are to believe the man responsible for contacting customers to schedule potential sales & share current incentives/deals doesn't know what he's talking about? They kept asking about my payment & the balance owed, said they needed that in order to give me a price on their truck. What does the balance on my truck have to do with the price of their vehicle, other than to work the numbers in their favor. Now I'm remembering why we drove to CA for our 2015. We got a better deal over the phone than we could get locally. As we're looking @ 2019's all of a sudden they remember they have a 2018 with bench seats & the same options as my truck, plus some! We go back across the lot, giving the benefit of doubt that maybe Tina had found it on their back lot or had been searching their inventory for us & discovered it! Nope. It was literally parked directly in front of the 3 ""company models"" they'd just shown us. They walked us right past it, all the while they're telling us they just don't have Escalades with 2 bench seats that often because it's not really a luxury item like the captains chairs. At this point I'm becoming understandably irritated because they're clearly being evasive & trying to steer us to what they want to sell. We do the test drive, it's great and it has the bench seats we need. Plus, Tina told us we'd get and extra discount because it was a 2018 that had been used as a rental/demo truck & had approximately 700 miles on it (& from my guess because they still have quite a few 2018's). It's now been hours & I need to go pick up our children so my husband says he'll stay & work out the numbers then I can just come back to sign. Thereafter, he said Sergio took over the deal. To clarify, the sticker price is the same as a brand new 2019 ($105k). Now Sergio tells my husband the only way he can ""give us"" the 0% on the 2018 is if we pay full sticker price. Obviously, the next question is why would we buy a leftover 2018, demo model with 700 miles & not a brand new 2019 for the same price? Sergio then claims we can't get 0% on a 2019 because it's not an offer, but that he'd ""let us"" if we really wanted to go that route. The dishonesty is unreal. This is old school bait & switch nonsense, all this info can easily be verified online. GM is offering 72mo/0% on a variety of makes/models. He's certainly not doing us a favor by allowing 0% on a 2019, it's a Cadillac dealer incentive. Ultimately, it was again, a waste of our time. Findlay Cadillac sales are not honest people & they seem to have no interest in moving their inventory unless you want to pay full sticker price, which is likely the reason their lot is loaded and not a single other customer came in during the 3 hours we were there.",0x80c8d11a27ee5b87:0x52202a7418fdf68a,Findlay Cadillac Henderson,36.0444444,-115.0283333,"['Cadillac dealer', 'Auto parts store', 'Car dealer', 'Car repair and maintenance', 'Used car dealer']",4.4,364,relevant

PROS: -Semi upgraded appliances -New or at least very clean carpet -Well painted -Comes with a storage closet on the patio -Garage is only $50 a month -EASY and quick access to the highway -Pet friendly -EXTREMELY helpful manager and courtesy patrol (once you get their direct line) -Grounds keepers help keep landscape neat since people refuse to pick up after their dogs -Ceiling fans (you would be surprised how many apartments in town don't have them... why not, we are a desert!) -Cheaper than equivalent style apartments in Summerlin -Very safe, even though not gated -ELEVATORS -TWO clubhouses and the gym has a proxy card so you can access it 24/7 -Washer dryer work great, they're stacked and in the bedroom -Decent closet size with shelves -Pretty large bathroom CONS: -Everything is electric (I HATE electric stoves) -Patio is so tiny it's hard to open the storage door AND have a chair out there. -The apartment stays warm all by itself. So, since Vegas is MOSTLY hot all the time, your AC will be running at least until November (as mine did, and I only had it set to 78) -People don't pick up after their dogs... especially people with large dogs. -The garages are small -Parking is a joke (more on that later) -Monthly pet fee per pet instead of just a deposit -No grass anywhere for pets -Windows are only on one side of the units (unless you get a corner 2nd+ story unit) so no cross-breeze On the warm apartment thing... this is nice in the winter. So far I've gone about a month now without needing to turn on the AC, and trust me, I don't need the heater. I had my windows open all night while it was a brisk, windy 45 last week and I STILL only got the place down to 67. Windows are closed and I'm back up to 72. It gets to 74 if I leave the windows closed for a couple days. Longer than that and my AC is kicking on. *GET A TANDUM PARKING GARAGE*. Trust me. If there isn't one near the unit you want, then move units. Parking is an absolute nightmare. You have to do the math--there are likely 2 cars per unit and I'd estimate.... at least 1200 units. You will NEVER get covered parking. If you can't get a tandum garage then get a regular garage, but make sure your car can fit in it (they're rather narrow--JUST LIKE THE PARKING SPACES). If you need storage (which, you will, everyone here uses their garage as storage) just cough up the extra cash and store across the street at the Storage One so that you can park in the garage. I have hit someone else's car trying to park in these narrow spaces. NOT all units are created equal. There is a floor plan with like 5 closets: the master closet, the linen closet next to the washer/dryer, another linen in the bathroom, a coat closet by the door and a pantry in the kitchen. PICK THAT UNIT. I live alone and I don't have enough storage. I literally have nowhere to put my vacuum, so it just sits in the living room as the most atrocious decor ever. I chose a first floor unit because I'm lazy, but there are cheaper units on higher floors and there are elevators, so it's easier to move into them. The price is comparable to the rest of the nice areas in town. You can find cheaper, but you're getting what you pay for (high crime and loud neighbors who fight). Prices have gone up, so when a 2 bedroom used to be 875, now one-bedrooms are averaging 950. I looked at units more east and north than this location: they were 950 with dirty carpet, peeling countertops and outdated appliances. The price here ranges from 850-1000 for a one-bedroom, and it's much nicer than the others I saw. Oh, also, someone threw up over their balcony, from like the 3rd floor, and the vomit went all over my neighbor's balcony wall on the 1st floor. Maybe keep that in mind when deciding what floor you want to live on. Otherwise, I see others' complaints here, and I disagree with most. Yes, there is a bug problem, but when you call for the bug guy he comes.",0x80c892df786df107:0xd70af218443ff502,Loreto & Palacio Apartments,36.2973495,-115.290924,['Apartment complex'],3.7,148,relevant

112779707704413365584,Crystal Schulz Home Loans,2020-06-17 21:40:00,1.0,"Sadly, I have to write this tragic review. My 8 year old and I decided we would get two white kittens for our home. We were connected with Lillian who was fostering the kittens and started to visit them weekly in March. We were told they would not be ready until late June but loved them so much we decided to wait. We have one current cat, a senior dog, and a few hamsters, which were all indicated in the initial application to adopt the kittens. We were asked to make weekly visits to Lillian's around her schedule which was nice enough but going there was awful as she is incredibly rude, and very abrasive to my daughter. June 15th... We are coming up on when I was told the kittens would be ready and I am told multiple times she needs to do my home visit. I have welcomed her openly to my home since April, which is 5 minutes from hers but she has made alternate excuses more than 3 times. So I made time last night June 17th for her to come see the house. Prior to the visit I did get additional shots for my cat that she did not need and over $500 in new equipment for the kittens. She came inside and although my home is shoe free she insisted on wearing her dirty sandals through. She was extremely rude and abrasive again, although I have complied with every request. She then tormented my dog who is literally dying of kidney failure with 2 unneeded strokes from around the back of his head; trying to provoke him. His toothless nipping at her in defense required her to state that if the dog did that to the kittens we cannot have them.... it was then I realized she was looking for a stupid excuse to not give us the kittens. Today I took time off work to go to the house and do a dog greet. My dog was very nice to the kitten she brought and we again bonded with the kitten. She then put the kitten into the crate, told me that she has a lot to think about, that she does not like my lifestyle, she does not feel comfortable giving us the kittens and then leaves.... leaves not just the kitten but two very broken hearts and a sobbing 8 year old. 3 months every week visiting and this crazy cat lady decided she did not like us personally. Very, very bad practice and absolutely not appropriate management of ""volunteers"". Lillian is a mean, ugly-hearted, horrible person who likes to take out her pain on people so please be VERY CAREFUL. 3/4 kittens got their owners swapped by week 10. Do not invest time going to her home, she will find a reason to screw you over. Horrible person, no solution provided by the organization. Unruly, crazy, not normal person making decision so beware she is irrational: Lillian.",0x80c8c0e6adffbe01:0xaed8f27d3c1b1e0b,Hearts Alive Village Las Vegas,36.1533583,-115.2426,"['Pet supply store', 'Pet adoption service']",4.4,198,relevant

I went to this place yesterday 9/10/2020, and wanted to buy 10 navy pro club shirts, and 10 Khaki pro club shirts. So a total of 20 shirts. I walk in and the older Asian guy behind the counter says hello and was eating his lunch. I ask if they have pro club heavy weight shirts and what the price is. A lady came out of the back and said ""7 dollars."" I said ok 7 dollars... Then the guy behind the counter asks me in an angry loud voice ""what color do you want?"" I said Navy, and also Khaki. I ask him to tell me what the total would be for the 20 shirts including the tax. He gets even more angry and loud and says HOW MANY DO YOU WANT! I said ""ten navy, and ten khaki"" trying to keep my cool. I asked what would be the total INCLUDING TAX. He said the tax is 8.25%. (I'm trying to negotiate with this man to see if I can get a discount for buying 20 shirts) I proceed to ask him that if I buy 20 shirts from him, if I can get a discount.... He pulls the shirts away and yells NO DISCOUNT! At this point i'm upset, as there's no need for the angry attitude and yelling. So I said ""no discount? Oh well, have a nice day,"" shrugged my arms and shoulders and walked out of there. I was willing to pay full price for the shirts but the way they treated me as a potential customer is unacceptable.

On a drive back from Utah, the A/C began having noticeable issues. At times it seemed like it was working, and at other times it was blowing warm air. It was not blowing any cold air into the rear. At this time, the A/C was still under the manufacturer's warranty. I took the van into Jim Marsh to have it looked at, and I was told that there was a ""clogged duct"" but that they unclogged it. It did seem to be working a little better. I asked if the freeon was low, and I was told that the level was 'within manufacturer's acceptable range"". That was the only explanation I could get. However, just two months later it began having the same issues. By this time, it was no longer under warranty (convenient) and they wanted to charge me to add freeon. Apparently, now that I was on the hook, it had now fallen below manufacturer's acceptable range. I should have realized this at the time and ran away from Jim Marsh. But, alas, they are close by and convenient, so I fell for their tricks again. Around this time my car was also having issues starting. I took it in and it was repaired. But then it began having the same issues about 2 days later. When speaking with the service rep, Chuck, he refused to believe that we were still having the same issues, because he had witnessed the van starting perfectly. When we took it back in, he finally admitted that it was still having issues. But rather than fix what I had already paid them to fix, they decided it was now an issue with the fuel pump. Long story short, over $1200 later, my van was still having the exact same issues. And they wanted another $1000-1500 to keep trying to figure things out (next up was the fuel rail). I took the van to a private mechanic, and he fixed the problem for under $500, by replacing the fuel pump that Jim Marsh had put in. The van then worked great, and I was able to trade it in somewhere else and get Chrysler and Jim Marsh out of my life forever. I probably should have challenged the Jim Marsh charges with my credit card company, but instead I've decided I'll post this review and try to discourage anyone from ever going there again.",0x80c8eb5497b802e3:0xf0622c3e7518002e,Jim Marsh Chrysler Jeep,36.2764593,-115.2827398,"['Chrysler dealer', 'Auto parts store', 'Car repair and maintenance', 'Jeep dealer', 'Used car dealer']",4.2,528,relevant

Couldn't believe I said that but I had been crying right before I arrived because I thought I was going to be laid off from my job. When I got up to the window I was totally embarrassed because my eyes were all red and puffy but the guy talked to me as if we had been friends for years. He was so at ease in his manner that he soon made me smile, and then he gave me a free churro and said not to worry because churros cure everything. That made me laugh so hard because I really love churros So I started to eat the churro right then and there while we chatted for a minute or so until another car pulled up, at which he sincerely wished me the best and assured everything would be ok. (It was not flirting by the way, I could be his mother). Everything was suddenly ok the moment I drove away. A stranger's concern was just a few moments of time for him, but it affected me for days in such a positive way. And you know what? Turns out everyone else there is just as nice as he is.

When we first moved in, everything seemed good and we were happy. Then the problems started. 1. We were told all appliances were new. Everything but the dryer, which burnt my wife's work clothes, my newborn son's clothes and an expensive blanket. We took pictures and showed the office via email and it took them 2 weeks to finally replace the dryer with a brand new one after continuously calling. 2. One of the boards under the sink fixture fell off and all it needed was to be wood glued back on and that took about 3 weeks since moving in. 3. There was a screw snagged in the carpet in the doorway to the master bathroom. 4. Numerous outlets are not secure. Anything you plug into them falls right out! 5. The cabinets arent secured tightly. I've had 2 come undone already. The first one took a while to fix and the second one I've been waiting a week to get fixed! 6. My upstairs, nextdoor and neighbor behind me are all obnoxiously different kinds of loud at the most inconvenient times. It's very inconsiderate to be stomping around after midnight, playing loud music starting at 4am, and yelling at eachother throughout the day. The walls are like paper. 7.

To Miriam: You obviously hate your job and your attitude shows it all. You probably have no where else to go and I dont blame you. With that attitude no one will hire you. You are worth minimum wage, NO TIP included. Even lucky they pay you with at least minimum wage. To Owner: I have been sitting down for at least 20 minutes and have seen all the customers that have been ordering food from Miriam come out dissapointed, frustrated, and do not look happy. I have also been reading reviews and I do see that your gyro meat comes with lots of fat chunks. It is true, fix because 90% reviews mention it. I also saw reviews about Miriam.

The room we stayed in overlooked the track WAY COOL! The instructors were all very patient and very knowledgeable, took what they did very seriously and focused on keeping us and everyone safe but at the same time magically helped us learn how to drive FAST:-) and have fun doing it. None of the staff took themselves too seriously but they created a very relaxed atmosphere while teaching us how to do what they do so well! By the way, I'm very frugal and do not spend money loosely or foolishly but I am just returning today from our 3 day ""level 1"" driving school at Spring Mountain and am already booking our return. Next time my wife and I will do two days of ""one on one"" private lessons. Again, I'm frugal but I have no idea how they let us drive their brand new Corvettes like this and make money charging us what they charge us! By the way I'm 6'10"" and they installed a custom seat so I could fit in the car with a helmet and it was glorious! But, being ""limited"" to my car because of the custom installed seat, I was really bummed when I saw on my dash my TPM showing a tire problem. They immediately took me into the mechanics bay and (I'm not exaggerating) with an instructor riding shotgun threw 4 mechanics at me and 1) found the problem and 2) changed out the tire in 25 seconds! Just like on tv! I was back out on the track and with my group without missing any track time! I don't know how they do what they do for the price they charge and we will likely go back at least twice a year and maybe more, my wife and I both think this is one of our ""top 5"" vacations and life experiences!",0x80c63bb1f0ab6129:0x44fc79f1e0cb5429,Spring Mountain Motor Resort and Country Club,36.1677081,-115.9109956,"['Country club', 'Car racing track', 'Driving school']",4.7,126,relevant

Tonopah and Austin may be the nearest locations if not Gabbs. The road is easily driveable with paved and well-packed dirt. Please remember the elevation is high, so the area can receive snow in winter. Also, drive carefully. We saw antelope and cows in the area. The shelter was easy to find (it's the giant red building!). Just follow the signs. It's a short walk or drive from the campground. The tour was great! Our guide was Anthony, who was very knowledgeable about the fossils and the history. He's been there several years and also brings that into his presentation. Let's talk about the dinosaurs though! There are 10 total ichthyosaur fossils, 9 still ""in situ,"" aka in the ground where they were. I will admit just looking at the fossils and surrounding dirt, the actual identification of fossils was hard until it was pointed out by Anthony. Because of this, I highly recommend the tour. It's only $5, 40 minutes, but breaks everything down well. Check the hours for your visit, but as of July 2, 2018, the hours were: MEMORIAL DAY TO LABOR DAY Monday-Friday: 10am and 2pm Saturday & Su day: 10am, 12 pm, and 2pm THIRD SATURDAY IN MARCH TO MEMORIAL DAY LABOR DAY TO THE SECOND SUNDAY IN NOVEMBER Saturday & Sunday 10am and 2pm SECOND SUNDAY IN NOVEMBER TO THIRD SUNDAY IN MARCH by advance reservation/staff availability only The fossil shelter is also the only place in the state park to purchase souvenirs, so time that visit!

I always enjoy coming here and time always goes fast. Its easy to spend six hours here without realizing it especially if you already enjoy casino games and interacting with others. Lots of diversity among the student pool. I spend lots of time in casinos already and when PCI is busy I find myself surprised with how closely it resembles a real casino environment.

All we will need is confirmation of receipt so we can have that compensation processed. We appreciate your patience and understanding with this matter."" I immediately wrote back saying to cancel the order and did what I should have done to begin with, hire a local printer that delivered cards in one hour. This was their response: ""Thank you for your email. Unfortunately, we are unable to cancel the order for full refund once production has began, only shipping cost will be returned in this case. We can also refund you shipping difference once the order is received, or you can refuse from package for full refund."" So they can't cancel the order but will refund shipping cost or refund partial shipping when I receive the cards or I can refuse the order and get a full refund? Why would they prefer to pay to ship the order and then refund it? That last email came 5 days ago and 9 days after I placed my order. In the meantime, no updates, no shipping details, and no cards.

Since then, I have been totally enamored with its history, its rise and fall. I have visited it at least a dozen times and was actually offered a portion of the locality if I agreed to teach school, in 1989, in Beatty, about five mills away. But the year round weather and its remoteness changed my mind. But that hasn't stopped my curious nature about the town and its history, and how it was stripped of it building materials that were used to build elsewhere (like the train wooden ties that was trucked to Death Valley Scotty's ""castle"", to be used as winter fire wood. It was never used, due to the deadly creosote content). But it is a shame that Rhyolite has been allowed to continue to crumble and decay, considering that 1980s rebirth of area mining again brought some wealth to the the Bullfrog Mining District. At least a few lovers of the town rebuilt the ""Bottle House"" before it collapsed.

They were actually horrible...They did not numb the area before putting the chest tube in me so for months afterwards, I'd have nightmares about the entire situation. I have had this exact proceedure done a few times and this was the absolute worst. The doctor that told me he had to watch a YouTube video on how to do it was better than this time at Spring Valley Hospital. I spent most of the time starving because no one knew when I could eat. I spent a lot of time in the most horrific pain imaginable. Imagine having a chest tube sewn to the inside of your body (they flipped my skin outwards, sowed the tube to the inside of my skin and flipped my skin back inwards) your person because the doctors did not put you under, give you any pain medicine, or numb the area. Oh, and when they took it out…no numbing…no medicine just scissors cutting my flesh. They tell you not to get up to go to the restroom until someone comes in a helps you...I crawled to the restroom many times on my hands and knees dragging the tube and stuff behind me because I would call every 5-10 minutes just to urinate. My friend found me in the bathroom on the floor and helped me to the bed during visitation hours because I had to urinate and I was not going to do that in the bed. When it was time to check out, I felt like I was being kicked out. They did not get me a wheel chair when I asked for one. They send me away with no medicine and a hole in the side of my body that ended up getting infected because they took the chest tube out and did not stitch the area. I was coming down from the pain medicine they gave me at the hospital and it was not a joyous occasion. My old apartment is 1 block from the hospital. I threw up 5 times on the 2 minute drive with my friend from the hospital to my apartment. I could not walk up the stairs. I was absolutely not functional and was not offered any home assistance. Like I said, I've been through this before and worse. I was sent home with medicine and information on getting a home health nurse because I live alone. Based on this experience, I'd rather die before going back to Spring Valley Hospital. I should probably post this on Yelp and Google since I spend a fair amount of time writing this and no one will read it or care either way. You'll just keep this up until someone comes along and decides they refuse to put up with it. I'm not rich so those are not things I can do...but now that I write this I may be inclined to submit a formal complaint. In the middle of a pandemic, a representative that speaks for Spring Valley Hospital decided it was funny and to say ""oh so that's why you're mad"" and laughed at me when I told them that it is the middle of a pandemic and I do not have a job. This is not a laughing matter. People are struggling to make ends meet and somehow it's a laughing matter when people call in telling you they are doing their best trying to pay the bills. You should wipe my slate clean simply because of this. I have told you that I am struggling to make ends meet and here you decide to laugh in my face. This is not okay. It will never be okay. It's stuff like this that tarnishes your image.

I purchased a used car, came there with two issues tire pressure sensor was lit and both left and right mirrors were not working. They said mirrors were just disconnected and once connected they both started working. I was not charged anything for that, so thank you. But then one of the mirrors stopped working again. I dropped my car there in couple of days for additional diagnostic. Verdict mirror is shortened from inside, you can buy mirror assembly and come to us for installation. The new part is about $1000, you can try to find a used one. I was charged $120 for this. Ok, I left. I have zero experience with fixing cars, but I tried to adjust the mirror few times and heard that it is trying to move, but cannot. Checked docs, found a part number for the actuator, purchased new original one for $100, replaced it by myself in 30 mins after watching a video on youtube. Why don't you guys offered me replacing just the actuator, but recommended buying the whole assembly? As for the tire pressure sensor issue after thorough diagnostic by their TPMS guru I was given this response sensors do not communicate with the computer. Two of them had no power at all, we replaced them and we know they all are working, but still do not communicate. We faced this problem second time with Lexus RX 350. Recommendation go to a dealership for diagnostics. Ok, I left. Opened user's manual, found the reason for this ""no communication"", fixed it myself by pressing one button. Do you guys want me to teach your guru for how to fix it? I am sure this guy knows about TPMS much more than I do, but there is always space for improvement. I was not charged for that though so thank you guys for the free sensors. While diagnosing these two issues a leak in the steering rack was found, which I was not aware of. Paid $1300 for the repair and $100 for wheel alignment. Well, this is probably something you regularly do so I most likely do not have doubts about the work you have done. Overall people are nice, space is clean, you will try to help, but used cars are full of surprises and you cannot put in too much effort, because you have to keep being profitable.

105950376461361414570,Sunzilla Lighting,2018-08-10 22:26:40,5.0,"(Translated by Google) On August 6th, I went to the Grand Canyon through the Las Vegas Korean-American Travel Agency on a day course. I was waiting for you to be picked up at your hotel at 7:30 in the morning, but you did not arrive late. Your guide explained the history of Hoover Dam and Lake Mead while traveling from Vegas to Hoover Dam. After a brief stop at Hoover Dam, I took a picture and moved to Lake Mead. It was better to understand the location of the actual Grand Canyon or Valley of Fire while looking at Lake Mead, the world's largest man-made lake. I took a photo shoot and heard about what I would be doing at the Grand Canyon during my trip to Arizona. I forgot about my hunger with the water, candy, and sweets that the guide prepared, but I was hungry soon. So, for more than an hour, I ran the national road to the entrance of the Grand Canyon, stopped by Joshua Forest, and went back to the Grand Canyon after hearing the guide's explanation. (It was also nice that you were considerate enough to take pictures at each stop.) When I arrived at the Grand Canyon, the first place I stopped by bus was a small town with the theme of the Western era. After lunch here, I stopped at Eagle Point, which looks like an eagle spreading its wings, and after listening to the explanation, I took the bus again and went up to Guano Point, the last course. I can't forget the view of the Grand Canyon from the last photo shoot, standing at Guano Point. I would like to thank the Grand Canyon, who made me feel the greatness of nature, and Jun for being able to take pictures and detailed explanations wherever I go. If you have a tour plan in Las Vegas, I would recommend a Korean-American travel agency.

114051453479523024515,Enter Name Here,2019-04-19 05:00:00,2.0,From my experience of my hotel room they were very small and gave me claustrophobia. There is also a major issue in the bathrooms. So the pole which hangs the shower curtain in the bathroom isn't permanently put on so DURING and AFTER my shower the pole of the shower curtain kept falling. Now I am no engineer or hotel designer but I don't think that is very professional. Even MOTELS have their shower curtains in tact! Also the thing I hate about the newer hotels is that in the shower there is no border between the shower of the floor and the bathroom floor so when you are showering the water gets all over the floor of the bathroom. I don't know why these newer hotels keep doing that if they don't even provide atleast a mop to clean up all the water from the bathroom floor with. See my pictures and you'll know what I mean. Although this hotel did have a small black borderline on the floor from the shower area and the bathroom floor it wasn't enough for the water to stay on one side of the bathroom. I don't think I'll ever be coming back or recommending this hotel to anyone unless I see improvements on the room. Thank you for reading my review.

I said I wasn't sure still because I'm going when my friend goes and I'm using her friend pass and she said that if I could sign up today she could try and look for a Band-Aid for me. So I walked away and went to try and do squats. Waited for her to leave and the other person to come up so I talked to that person and said I've been bleeding for a while and asked if he could find a Band-Aid because I don't want to get blood all over the equipment.

That was the only part of this experience that was pleasant. I get an email a few hours later from ""bulldog911"". They do not introduce themselves, or indicate where they are emailing from, or ""thank you for contacting purrfect pet doors."" Its just some random email that says"" There is alot of Q and A, please call 379-0609 thank you"" that's the whole email.

We were sorely disappointed and decided to never go back. Well, my extended family had a group dinner there tonight and we went as well, hoping that our last experience was a fluke. Our server was efficient and attentive, but could have been better. However, the food was horrible. Most of the dishes looked like they had been sitting out for weeks. There was a quarter inch layer of brown, cracking dried-up sauce atop one of the soups. The refried beans had a similar layer on top of it. Everything that we were brave enough to eat was nowhere near luke warm. The beef roast from the carving station was dry and rubbery. About halfway through our first plate, both my wife and I started feeling pains in our lower abdomen which later turned into horrible noxious gas. The 1 reprieve that I was hoping for was desert. They are known for having an awesome spread, but I left the station with a little of everything and my plate left my table with almost the same amount still on it. The banana pudding literally made me and my wife bag. And I'm known for having a very strong stomach. The fudge was reminiscent of play dough with sugar added.

I took a puppy to get checked out because his temp was lowering, and had being trying to puke with no success. When I put my finger in his mouth to see if anything was stuck I found nothing, besides the fact my finger was now covered in blood. He was having trouble breathing as well, and at the arrivel to SVS he was taken shortly after he was taken it became ever so that apparent they were hounding me for a decision. Not to mention it was 2 in the morning, and this was a lot to take in. I was given 4 options take him home to die, pay a 900 deposit, euthanize him, or surrender him. I was very hard pressed to surrender him by all in the hospital. He was a very young pup about 4 months old, a very good looking dog. I felt pressured by staff As if one of the had found an interest in him, and wanted me to surrender rights beings a SVS employees have first choice to adopt the puppy. Now trying to contact the hospital to ask if he made it through the night and they refuse to tell me anything about him at all. I researched the legal aspect and read that they are allowed to give the information on his status, but refused to.

When she was ready to polish them i asked her again to cut them down. She said im finished. Ready to polish. I told her no she wasnt because she needed to cut them down. She didnt want to. Her unpleasant attitude got worse after that. When the service was done i couldn't wait to leave as an unpleasant attitude from start to finish should never happen in a place of business. In the car i looked at my nails and i am highly disappointed. My nails are bumpy where they weren't filed right and some are way thicker than others. I had to refile them on the ends to smooth them so as when i touched people it wouldnt scratch them.. Because they arent smooth as they should be it makes the polish look bad. And the thickness on the ones that are too thick look like press on nails. I will have to go tomorrw to a different shop to try and get them fixed to look half way decent. Paying another shop to fix what i paid to have done. I really dont think this shop cares if thier customers are dissatisfied or not.

The food just isn't very good. The beef is so salty that all I could taste was salt, salt and more salt. I guess that's what the sauces are for but I'm not a sauce dressing fan. I guess I'm sort of a purist because I think if the food at its core is tasty, you shouldn't have to drown it in sauce to make it edible and that's what is going on here. Heed the warnings about that hot sauce; it is H-O-T and that is not a myth that's overblown. That mess will light your butt on fire! The sad pita bread was just gross. I'm a bread addict and even I didn't want to eat it. I'm not sure if it's made in-house, but I wouldn't be surprised if it's not. There was nothing fluffy nor fresh nor appetizing about it. It was bad. The tomatoes, lettuce and cheese were just your run of the mill, straight off the food delivery truck quality. The ONLY good thing on my plate was the rice, and it is clearly the superstar. Flavorful, light and fluffy, it's worth eating (which is fortunate because it takes up the majority of the container)! This place is expensive and the portion size of the meat is too small for what it costs. I don't want to pay $10 for a lunch that consists mostly of cheap rice! The employees are very friendly, competent and willing to help, and the crunchy falafels are a tasty vegan option (serious vegans beware: the line workers aren't as careful as they should be about cross contamination; I saw one lady scooping meat and then falafels with the same utensil).

In Florida we don't have legal access to whole flowers, only oils, capsules, vape pens, and some whole flowers sealed in cups you can vape. I find the quality of the vape carts from Essence is far and above what we get in Florida. The whole experience was great. It might be a bit different experience if you don't have a medical card and go to the recreational side due to the long wait during 5 o'clock rush hour on a Friday.

Although it is true, ross has very good products at very good prices, but it is unfortunate that the staff (which is the image of a company) has so little discretion and tino to treat the customer buy a product in Tampa Fl, when I arrived in Vegas, I noticed that the security pin had not been removed, I went to a ross in rainbow and the staff was very friendly, they explained that they did not have the machine to demagnetize and offered me my money back, 9.99 or go to ross of the strip because there if they had the machine when talking with the manager, his answer was I returned to Florida, because that way you have the receipt and the blouse the tag, I can not See in the security video if this product was purchased or not. The security pin that my blouse had, was not the pin of ross (they took it out when paying for my product) the pin that my blouse still has is the one that Ross suppliers had to remove when selling the product. As you can expect quality of service in a company if the manager is the first to promote the lack of quality in the treatment of the client. Really sorry. Even more regrettable is knowing that this deal will continue and just as the manager sent me back to Florida to solve a 9.99 problem, I will do the same with other future clients. This happens on monday, march 10 at 9:00 pm (Original) Pesimo servicio al cliente. Si bien es cierto, ross tiene muy buenos productos a muy buenos precios, pero es lamentable que el personal (que es la imagen de una empresa) tenga tan poco criterio y tino para tratar al cliente..... compre un producto en Tampa, Fl, al llegar a Vegas note que no me habuan removido el pinn de seguridad, fui a un ross en rainbow y el personal fue muy amable, me explicaron que no tenian ahi la maquina para desmagnetizar y me ofrecieron la devolucion de mi dinero, $9.99 o que fuera a ross del strip porque ahi si tenían la maquina.... al conversar con la manager, su respuesta fue..... regrese a Florida, porque asi tenga ud el recibo y la blusa el tag, no puedo ver en el video de seguridad si este producto fue comprado o no. El pinn de seguridad que mi blusa tenia, no era el pinn de ross (ese lo sacaron al pagar por mi producto) el pinn q mi blusa aun tiene es el que debieron remover los proveedores de Ross al venderles el producto. Como se puede esperar calidad de servicio en una empresa si el manager es el primero en promover la falta de calidad en el trato al clirnte. Lamentable realmente.

The staff there was extremely helpful in educating us on their programs, working with us to get her admitted, and with working with us financially. I also appreciated the education they provided for families to understand addiction.

But if you're looking for better customer service by going to Savemart, don't expect to find it. The cashiers used to be pleasant and nice to talk to, but now it's a crapshoot. When I dare to pay the high prices at Savemart, I expect a little coridalness at the register. Especially when I'm trying to be friendly even though I just paid over $4.00 (might as well be $5.00) for a gallon on milk because they were out of the $3.98 brand.

He looked confused and then said he'd ask about it. About 10 minutes later the wine steward came over and said if we shared the wine pairing, he could only pour one glass. We objected, saying most restaurants are happy to pour two glasses. He said okay but we would each get just a tiny amount. He was obviously trying to sell us two wine pairings. We agreed to his terms. Then we sat there and waited...and waited for about 15 or 20 minutes while waiters scurried past with food for other customers. We finally got up and left. We called another restaurant, a favorite of ours (we are locals), and they had room for us so we hopped on the tram and went to the other location, This restaurant welcomed us.

Then going to the wrong bank and having to leave because of a family emergency then I might as well as leave to attend to my wife. ""April fools"".

What seemed to be a good idea to move back to be with our loved ones turned out to be the cruelest joke of all. My mother-in-law was diagnosed with Cervical cancer and was expected to pull through but unfortunately a kidney infection would ravage her body as the infection was spreading rapidly through her body and she had no choice but to leave us..My wife would always prank call her mother on April Fool's Day and she would always fall for it. Now I know why Arizona Cardinal's wide-receiver Larry Fitzgerald would keep his mother's phone line on just like my wife would've loved to hear her mother answer the phone today. She would've probably said ""April Fool's pendeja, si no estoy muerta!"". ""For Reals"". I really wish April Fool's was a real day where our loved ones were just away on ""vacation"".

I just left because it didn't seem like there was a resolution coming from him.

It was my sister's birthday so we wanted to treat her to a nice dinner. Our server was nice and knowledgable. Our drinks came out quickly. The trouble this visit was the food. Every steak was overcooked, though and lacked the flavors we have been accustomed to when dining here. To add insult to injury, my dinner was literally dropped onto my niece. Yep, right into her lap, staining her top and pants with juices. (We had tickets for a show right after dinner & she had to attend in these clothes). The mgr visited the table but only offered to dry clean the clothes. My food arrived late due to this and I ended up with the wrong cut of meat. Dessert was good. All in all we ordered several rounds of drinks, appetizers,entrees and dessert with a bill over $1400. We left a substantial tip for the server but considering comments from our guests that the dessert was better than the steak leaves us to try another steak house when we return to Las Vegas.

The problem with this station is the ""Up"" escalator. The past several times I've been through this station it has not worked and that's been over the course of 5 years. I can't imagine that thing is broken all the time, but it sure seems that way to the occasional visitor. There is an elevator, so people who can't use stairs can still get up to the platform.

The burger itself was tiny and upon finishing it my fiance wanted to leave $15 on the table and leave as I had only had one bite of my food. We brought it to our waiters attention when he came to get the plates, we told him how bad the food was. He didn't care, gave us the bill and we left. Worst $30 spent.

I have been buying at Caseys for years as there is no better option in Vegas but more often than not, they don't have what I am looking for or what they do have is so outrageously priced that I refuse to buy from them. I recently purchased a new backpack from Adorama for $180 after shopping at Caseys and having the sales girl tell me that the $280 price that they had on the same exact bag is the correct price. Maybe they are buying their stuff from the sales on-line retailers that anyone can buy from, adding a huge markup, and reselling the items. If I am looking for something simple like a filter then they usually have what I need. The last time I stopped by there it was to purchase 3 of the new pocketwizards for the canon cameras and they did not have any at all. The sales guy said they only stocked them one at a time but if I wanted to special order them they could get them in a couple of weeks. I got them from B&H and even with 2 day shipping it was still slightly cheaper than what they would have been at caseys with the tax included. If I want to order something, I can do that on the internet and pay no taxes, get free shipping, and still have it faster than they can. Las Vegas really has no real camera store anymore but this one is as close at it comes. Everyone wants to open a storefront, wait until someone needs something then order it from B&H, add a 50% markup and resell it to you. Why would I want to pay them for something that I can do very easily myself. If you don't want to be a real store and stock the merchandise you are trying to sell, then close the store and go find a real job.

I originally came into the store and looked for the camera that I found online. When trying to find the camera, I was unsuccessful- I asked for help and although the staff member was nice, he was not helpful. I ended up buying another camera even after asking the employee if the camera I saw online that seemed be available for pick up here was not actually in store. When I got home, I went to double check online to see if the camera could still be picked up and it was! So I purchased the camera I wanted and set it for pick up this morning. I went to the online pick up/exchange area- there was not clear line or staff helping. I waited at the exchange counter until I flagged someone down and asked if I needed to return my camera and pick up the one I ordered online- she said this was the line. However people who were waiting in the ""online pick up line"" were actually waiting to exhcange/return items. I let them go in front of me since they had been waiting longer and clearly were frustrated with the lack of communication. It was a busy holiday weekend and it seemed that customer service was not a priority. When I finally got to cashier, I told her I wanted to return this camera but I wanted to make sure my online purchase was available (I was worried that since I bought it online it might be sold out due to the holiday pricing). She didn't do much- just asked people for a device- i think to check my online purchase. after 7-8 minutes of just standing there I asked her if she needed me to do anything since I was just standing there with my ID out. she told me it would be best to stand in line for the online pick up and they would be able to handle my return..... So i went back to another line- I understand there are two different systems however I would have appreciated if the exhchange/return cashier had communicated to the person right next to her that was handling online pickups and ask them to assist me instead of standing in line again. Once I received the camera I ordered online I said that the other cashier indicated you could help me with my return camera= I was then told to go back to the other line. IT WAS INCREDIBLY FRUSTRATING AND A HUGE WASTE OF MY TIME. I stood in three different lines which were next to each other on the sam line of cashiers.... I don't know why I shop here.

The one thing I really like about them is the maintenance team. They come really quickly, fix whatever needs to be fixed and is really nice from what I've seen so far. The office staff is nice as well, had a few miscommunications on some fees with them but they seem willing to assist and sit down and break things down to where everyone is on the same page. My main thing is maintenance though, they are better than a lot of other complex's I've lived in. They just know what they are doing. Have fixed the AC, my toilet, leaks in the sink all the same day I requested it too. Place is nice overall as well. It is a bit on the pricey side and you do pay for everything water sewage etc but, they make up for it in other areas which again for me is the maintenance and upkeep of the place in general.

They overbook, are ""so busy"" and the quality of service has really declined. The people who book the ""appointments"" don't seem to be in touch with the agents, as with my last experience. After an hour's drive to arrive for my appt, I was told ""there was no way they could get me in today"", with no apology, but rather disdain from the agent and additional comments to the effect that I was the idiot for even thinking I could get in. It was a safety bag issue, I did not choose the appt. and the person who assigned me the appt over the phone assured me that it needed to be taken care of ASAP. I expressed my dismay at not being able to ""get in"" that day, and when I left told the agent I would not be back. He replied with ""OK"", never once offering an apology for wasting my day/time.

Here goes 1 Arrived at our designated time, no one was ahead of us, yet were made to wait while hosted answered a call. 2- Once escorted to our table, the gentleman didn't even bother pulling out the chair for us. If he had, he'd have seen the chunk of MEET LAYING ON THE FLOOR by it. Apparently the no one bothered to vacuum. I brought it to their attention, and we were moved to the table right next to it. 3- Next came to complimentary roll. Let me just say Olive garden has better bread. This roll was extra brown, hollow, chewy & cold...totally inedible. *At this point I told my BFF we should leave, but she really wanted to eat at Emeril's restaurant, and every birthday girl should get her wish. So we stayed....wrong!!!! 4- We proceeded to order cocktails. They were good but not worth $18 each. (Ordered 4). Once again, our intention was to have a nice, fancy dinner, so we knew we'd be dishing out some cash & expected great food & service to match the cost. 5- We ordered the Cracklins appetiser...it was really good. ($10) 6. We had already looked at the menu ahead of time and knew we'd be ordering the Surf and Turf. I just needed clarification on the portion size. Our waiter assured us it was a small 9oz steak & 5oz Lobster tail ($80). We decided to order 2 instead of sharing, since the waiter said it was a small portion. 7. While we waited, I asked for a to go box for the Cracklins & some additional dipping sauce to go with it, since it was a big portion & I wanted to enjoy my steak & Lobster. The waiter's assistant brought the box with a small empty container for our leftover sauce which was about a teaspoon....who does that!?! Any other restaurant brings a fresh sauce in a to go container. 8. Finally, our beautiful looking dinner arrived. The steak was sooooo delicious. Unfortunately, I can't say the same for the Lobster. 9. This was my 1st time ordering lobster, but I'm pretty sure it's suppose to be flakey & soft. What I was served was a TOUGH, RUBBERY, CHEWY I had to use my hands to pull out the tough meet from it's shell. 10. While the assistant cleaned off our table, she asked how it was. I was honest with my response....""the steak was delicious, but the lobster was tough, rubbery & chewy"" I answered. The piece of lobster was still on my plate. She rolled her eyes and left, not acknowledging me. I saw her speaking with what seemed to be a manager. 11. The grand finale....our waiter came over to our table, apologized for the Lobster and proudly told us the manager would be comping our appetiser. REALLY!!!! Our bill was $250 after the comp. I came prepared to pay & did not ask for the comp, but really I was INSULTED. WORST BIRTHDAY DINNER...ugh. This place was horrible. Emeril would be appalled is he received this type of service at his own restaurant. SAVE YOUR for the slot machines!!!

Their dress lady is awesome and very sweet, the Rev. Nature is amazing and makes this an experience to remember. The photos leave you sad, they don't seem ""professional"" quality, and the moment is soured when at the end the photographer sits you down to see your photos, while throwing 3 envelopes at you that each suggest a $40-60 tip for each, while watching to see how much you put into each. One for the minister (which you literally just paid cash for separate from their other fees) one for the photographer and one for the dress lady. We just paid $100 for the dress and tux, so I assume the other $90 is going directly to the photographer or is split between her and the venue, since our package explicitly included her. She tried telling us she didn't get paid if we didn't pay her extra. I'm not buying it. So be prepared for a cheap deal, and a guilt trip for more money if you choose this place.

Now they say its a 3 night minimum instead of my original 2 nights. That is a better option than losing my money so I requested it. They denied my change in dates, then when I asked about why they denied it, they said it is out of their control as my contract is with AirBnB. In speaking with AirBnB, they cannot make adjustments to reservations without the renters consent, which makes sense. To get ahold of anyone at Turnkey, I was on hold, multiple days in a row for no less than 30 minutes each time. Every time I am told the same thing, its not their problem, contact AirBnB.

The restaurant was a little busy but we were sat right away. Our server took a bit to get to us but was very friendly when she did. We placed our appetiser and drink order and off she went. My husband got a local beer on tap and then was told they didn't have it (this seriously always happens when we come) I asked for water w lemons. Never got my lemons, asked twice then gave up! Our app took 20min then our food came right after. I ordered endless soup and salad which is suppose to come w chips never got them and never got a second helping but was still charged for endless! Our server checked on us at the beginning and then to clear plates so even if I did want more of the over salted soup I didn't have much of an option! The chicken in my sons quesadilla was chewy he actually spit out a couple of bites. Also, I went to the restroom and immediately walked out they were a mess!

112282871418071132801,Nick Litten,2019-06-13 23:53:20,1.0,"Wow. Posting my first horrible dealership experience. I'm new to Henderson, just bought a pre-owned 2013 Audi A5 Cabriolet. First few weeks of ownership and I love the car. Discover it has an open Recall for a new air-bag. Should have been simple right? Oh No a trail of errors followed: Checked into Audi Henderson for the day Airbags fitted I collected my A5, but ten minutes into homeward journey, suddenly get hard engine vibration and the dashboard lights up like a Christmas tree. I limped off the interstate, and head back to Audi Henderson to have the mechanic report the oil plugs are badly coked up. Leave it for investigation. Next day I'm told a seal on the oil pump is faulty causing small oil spots I've seen and I need a new oil pump as well. This doesn't sound right to me, but I'm not the Audi Mechanic and since I want this car to be in tip-top condition, I authorize both bits of work thinking it's better to have it all done. My first mistake. Next day, collect car after paying $300 for the spark plugs (very expensive but ""hey its a dealership"") and a slick $800 for the replaced oil pump. Disgruntled, after being told there was no discount that could be applied for my troubles, I collect and drive off. Almost home, fifteen minutes later... engine warning lights and the low oil dashboard warning. Immediately call the dealer and I'm told to bring it back again. After yet more waiting around, I'm told they had forgotten to fill with oil. Very apologetic front desk personnel, but no discount apart from a free quart of oil as it was filled on the forecourt. Do they test drive cars after work? Shoddy attention to detail and inflated prices. I won't be back. EDIT UPDATE MAY 2019 One month later I have a catastrophic engine failure driving to work. Heavy vibration, obviously misfiring, I limp off interstate straight into a different Service Shop who investigate engine code and tell me the Turbo has failed. Investigation shows the Turbo has a crack in it. This is most likely the cause of the oil spots!! One week and $3,500 later I have a new turbo installed but when we fire the car up, its car running (badly) and engine system warns I have no compression on cylinder one. Mechanic tells me that driving with no oil is most likely the cause of burnt cylinder internals and likely caused the failure. I go and buy a beer. Cry into it. Audi do not supply a cylinder repair option so I've been quoted $5,000 for a new engine plus to fit. #aaargh EDIT UPDATE JUNE 2019 Brice, the service Manager from Audi Henderson returned my call today. #huzzah The result of the call isn't exactly a resounding result but its better than nothing. Audi have offered to do an engine inspection for $free it sounds like the mechanical version of every 50 year old mans colon exam; with cameras. Hopefully it will show the extent of the damage and give an engine rebuild $quote which I can compare against the cost of a replacement engine. Having said that it was refreshing to have a frank discussion even if it didn't end up with the sentence ""of course we can fix that engine for $free""",0x80c8d1236d48c3cd:0x3707d18cedc364e4,Audi Henderson,36.0470943,-115.0187531,"['Audi dealer', 'Auto parts store', 'Auto repair shop', 'Used car dealer']",4.9,1537,relevant

Service was AWFUL! Servers were not cordial at all, seemed like they were not enjoying their job. 2. Manager was incompetent. We ordered a few plates for lunch and one of them was a chicken salad. The chicken seemed to have been left in the fridge for a long time and went right through into the plate. It was insanely cold. We explained that the person who ordered it had some issues with acid reflux and the FREEZING food would worsen it. We mentioned the waitress about this issue and she was going to help us addressing this concern. The manager came back saying that's the way the plate is, we don't have microwave to heat it up, so nothing to do. The waitress was very embarrassed about his response and kept excusing for this bad response. So, we are not the only ones noticing it.

She and the manager, John, walked me through the entire process. Even though it was rent day and busy, both were patient and professional. I was approved and on my way home the next day. Best of all the rent was reasonable for the location and the views are serene. Everything was completed and processed online, including signing the lease and making any applicable payments. Two months later Jennifer was the consultant on duty when my husband and I moved in. She continued the courtesy and professionalism exhibited by her co-workers. The apartment had new carpet and, aside from a few minor issues which were taken care of immediately, I was very satisfed with the condition. So far I am very glad we moved here. So many qualities made this seem like a nice place to relocate.

I have PTSD and high level of anxiety, I ended up crying in a exam room with the vet bashing me about how I was a horrible owner to let it get this bad and I didn't take care of my dog. After that fact I brought my dog home and had to take my baby to the er and when I came home early in the morning I found that my dog scratched most of her fur off her muzzle and was bleeding. I called around to try and find anyone that would take walk-ins as my dog's regular vet does not. I found this place but after my last experience at a different animal hospital I was very anxious about coming here. I came in and was helped immediately with great customer service, they helped me throughout the process and the wait time wasn't that long for a walk in only 30-45 minutes which is great to me. The vet's tech (I think that is what you call her) Beckie, was great with my dog as she didn't drag my dog as the other animal hospital did she listened when I told her to give my dog her command and she would go. I only had to wait maybe two minutes and the vet came in to see my dog. Dr. Luikart was very nice to me and explained what my dog had and how quickly it can spread along the body if you don't know what you are looking out for. I informed her that my dog's regular vet said at first it was an allergy of her food possibly and after switching foods it did clear up but then started to come back then my vet said it was probably because she was covered with fleas when she came from California and that she has hot spots. The other animal hospital determined it was a specific type of mites that was causing it but only gave pills to help with the skin not anything to help her internally. Dr. Luikart informed me she was also going to give my dog a pill to help internally and a shampoo to help her skin too. This animal hospital was very nice and compassionate to me.

We where just a few blocks away from home and just left the pet hospital with two dogs so we relied on Uber. The ride lasted around 10 minutes at best from Flamingo to Tropicana area behind UNLV. One of the dogs just got treatment for an ailment so we had to get home so he could get some rest. Unfortunately in getting out of the car and handling the dogs, she dropped her phone on the floor in the back seat area. She discovered that once we got inside she was missing her phone. So without her phone we had trouble contacting the driver Mellisa via last paid trip. I got lucky and called her phone that was lost and Mellisa answered. Uber normally charges 15 dollars for a driver to go out of route so when she told me she found the phone in the back seat area she was heading back to bring the phone. We waited and waited. Mellisa never showed up, so I contacted Uber through my app and she did as well. Here it is 30 some hours later we get a message that the phone was dropped off way across town at a Green light Hub on Fort Apache. Shame on you Mellisa and you too Uber I had to get yelled at all night and most of the day today inconsiderate and not bringing the phone back and she has wheels. That Uber driver Mellisa won't have any good luck for this. That's why her rating surely will not be five stars after this review.

It took a long time for doctors to get things figured out, but nobody at Las Vegas Cremations ever called with updates. Many times I was told somebody would call me back but they never did. I was the one who had to initiate the call every time. The reason they're still getting four stars from me is very simple. When somebody dies it is one of the most vulnerable times in your life. I've had other funerary, Mortuary and cremation companies take advantage of that by trying to upsell you on unnecessary items, jewelry, urns, and coffins. Las Vegas cremations did none of that. We explained to them what our budget was and what we were attempting to do and they helped us reach that at a very reasonable cost.

However they recently made BIG changes to the happy hour menu making it seem completely different. Cheeseburger sliders which we would all get every week have been completely removed from the happy hour menu. So i ordered the bbq chicken flatbread which i have had many times still tastes the same but is cut differently and looks as though it is far less food. Crunchy spicy tuna rolls which is another thing i get every time are made differently now and look like there is less effort put in them along with being less crunchy. I did not check if they removed lagunitas ipa from happy hour but the price went from 4$ to $6.50 for the same sized beer. Have loved this place and have come almost every sunday for happy hour and other days not during happy hour but with such major changes im afraid i will not be returning nearly as often.,0x80c8bf8420ed52bd:0xca3d80a5fa2d1e26,Kona Grill Boca Park,36.1638456,-115.289949,"['American restaurant', 'Cocktail bar', 'Sushi restaurant']",4.4,1304,relevant

We moved in a rental, made arrangements with Aiden, did everything he asked, then he broke his word and had us evicted. We cleaned as much as we could. This place was a wreck when we got here. We had to stop because he promised a dumpster, several times, it never showed. He told us to not fix our swamp cooler, he would have 'Mike' come by. Mike is apparently a ghost, as we never did see him. All is well... this place will look exactly like we found it when we got here (old motor in swamp cooler and all). Three children to worry about, but he doesn't care. This place is a joke, and more people that he's done wrong need to come forward. If you're looking for a place in Silver Springs, I'd not go through this place. James Dwiggins is about to find out about Aiden and his 'tactics'. Word is bond, and his is worthless! If you think I'm just an angry nobody who didn't pay their rent, that is not the case. Ask around town. Every restaurant in town has a special sauce for Aiden, and he didn't even know. Yeah, what a guy... And now, well over a year later, Aiden is no longer the property manager (but is still employed, somehow), and now they're trying to say the trash here is ours. I guess they think we're small potatoes here in Silver Springs, as they've stated ""it's a waste of their time even being here"". Now, they said the house was sold, we'd be getting a 30 day no cause and would be good until the 31st of August. (have this on video)... house didn't sell, now they sent a 5 day pay or quit, via email (haha). Rod and Barbara are not to be trusted, and I'm not to be toyed with. Now we go to big boy court, with many witnesses of what the property looked like, and issues w/ Realty World themselves.. hop aboard the tort express!! Rod, I knew this was coming, it's why I recorded you in the first place. See you in court... as this seems like retaliation for us telling them the trash was not ours.

And for full transparency, I have no preconceived bias since I do not know the owner or the people that wrote the negative reviews. But if you look at the facts, they don't lie. All Federal, State, and Local laws were followed. The owner did not have a crystal ball and could not predict the future. Blaming the owner is like blaming a car INSTEAD of the person who got in that car and drove drunk and killed someone. Was it a tragedy? Of course, no one can deny that. But the fact of the matter is that the 2nd amendment gives rights to bear arms so long you can pass a background check with no criminal record. If the owner refused to sell someone a firearm based upon the way they looked then that would be blatant discrimination which by the way discrimination laws is also protected by our Constitution. What if someone would pass a background check but the owner didn't like the color of their skin so didn't sell to them, do you see how ridiculous that sounds? You can't pick and choose when it comes to someone's Constitutional rights. If one of you wanted to buy a firearm, had no criminal background, and passed every background check but the owner refused to sell to you, then you would cry discrimination. Do you see how hypocritical that sounds. The 2nd amendment is just as protected as the 1st amendment or any amendment for that matter. All of you that are writing negative reviews, if there was no 1st amendment, then you could possibly go to jail over the reviews you wrote since you would have no freedom of speech or laws protecting such, you wouldn't like that I bet? So you can't pick and choose which amendments are right and which are wrong. For the record, I'm a neither a Democrat or Republican. I'm a logical thinker that sticks with the facts and law. It's not right to try to defame someone or their livelihood if they are a law abiding person. If you don't like guns, then write to your local Congressman or Senator to remove the 2nd amendment from our Constitution. But if you pick and choose which ones to follow, then that threatens the very framework and fabric of our Democracy. You have every right to vote for Politicians that you feel would represent our Country and Constitution the best (right to vote which is also protected by State laws). If you think about it logically it's really unjustifiable hate that kills more than anything. If you take it out on the vessel but not the actor then why aren't we banning cars, knives, or even bleach? All these items can kill someone. I stand with the owner, and his business should not be disrupted over this. I'm sure he is very much as hurt as we all are, if not even more so.

Everyone working there was all smiles and confident.(had a friendly dog there too!) Everyone was encouraging and answered any questions we had. I had originally scheduled my jump weeks in advance. First time jumper. Im a big guy and was worried about my weight, 230-250, but they said no issues. They match you with a size appropriate instructor and get you going. I was also worried about clothing and weather-temp at height. But it's so fast you don't need to worry about being cold. I wore 5.11 pants, hiking boots and a long sleeve tee with over shirt. (Was a little warm in it) They took us up quickly, got us to height and once the door opened they dont give you alot of time to think about what's going on. Door opened, final safety check, high fives and fist bumps. Then out we went. Was AMAZING. Nothing like I thought. You land just out from takeoff so anyone with you can watch. Was great. My wife wanted to jump but was on the fence. Once I got back after the jump, she decided to do it and they rushed to get her on the next plane. She was TERRIFIED. But when she landed she said it was terrifying AND amazing. For someone with a fear of heights they made the great experience. Our tandem instructors were amazing. Mine was Rafa(pronounced Hoffa). He made me feel comfortable right away. Good instruction, easy to follow. It didn't seem like a ""job"" to be my tandem instructor. My wife's tandem was McCaan.

The staff there were really helpful and prescribed me Cephalexin and told me to follow up with Dr Hugh Burt in two weeks time. Cephalexin helped but did not make the Cellulitis go away. The office was very busy that day and I ended up waiting for 3 hours total for a 45 minute appointment, in which 30 of those minutes I spent naked on the table waiting for the doctor to come back in after he stepped out to let me change, it took me a total of 3 min to get changed. Meanwhile he was seeing several other patients. Either way, he came back into the office, pushed around on the infected area for a while while as I cringed, and than said he will prescribe me Clindamycin, even though I have taken this antibiotic before and it has not helped. I have been battling this infection for over 2 months now and it is no longer a mild infection and I believe he should have prescribed me on something to finely cure it, not to milk it another two weeks so i would need to come in to the office again and pay for another appointment and then perhaps prescribe something like Vancomycin, Daptomycin or Linezolid to cure it. I dont understand why it is that this doctors insists I finish a medication that is not helping my infection and is making it worse. Either way I don't believe that this doctor went about the appointment in a professional manner, and it seemed as if they were just trying to schedule as many appointments as possible, even if it means people would have to make multiple visits. what do you think?",0x80c8c51dcfe166d5:0x911b916db190d82f,Burt Hugh MD,36.1144904,-115.1142908,"['Internist', 'Doctor']",3.0,15,irrelevant

Alas, I returned a week ago to finally have the superb chorizo, eggs and ranchero sauce grace my tongue again once more. Shortly after receiving my meal I found myself in a deep state of despair and disappointment. Not only had they changed the way in which the dish was prepared, they had eliminated the ranchero sauce and replaced it with a salsa verde and decided to still name it ""Huevos Rancheros"". IT IS NOT HUEVOS RANCHEROS WITHOUT RANCHERO SAUCE! It is simply a chorizo scramble with salsa verde and pathetic oversized pinto beans and a tortilla. When I asked the waitress if I was crazy or if the dish had been changed, she confirmed it was different and informed me that several customers had complained about the new entree and the owner refuses to change it back.

We didn't want our bill going up ridiculously because we know what we can financially handle comfortably. The guys who helped us (I won't blast their names) kept going back and forth with the manager throwing the ""free"" tablet in our face. Also throwing in some ""discounts"" which after I checked my receipt, was only $1 here $2 there. (I thought it would be a signficant amount). Just a heads up for people who don't upgrade as often, that you end up paying a monthly plan for the $100 tablet. It's only free if you get a plan for it. (They never told us this) They also promised us a gift card that we never got. Now that's all fine and dandy for people who want a tablet plan but they did not mention any of that to us. We would've not gotten it cause it does not fit our budget. They said our bill would only go up x amount. It ended up going up $60. All in all, the free and discounted bells and whistles all come with a price. I don't want this happening to other people so that's why I'm writing this review and making Sprint customers to be aware.

I had an eye infection a few years back that Dr. Lee treated diligently (and successfully). I went elsewhere for two years while they worked out issues with their insurance, but was happy this year to be able to once again make an appointment with a doctor's office that I enjoyed. However, in the two year interim, things have drastically changed. I made an appointment and on the phone explained that I had changed vision insurance. When I showed up for my appointment, I checked in and waited to be asked for my identification and insurance information. That never happened. Either they are very trusting or not properly running their office. Eventually, I was called back for my appointment. The tech began performing tests and I explained that I wanted to update both my glasses and contacts prescription. That was when he told me that they no longer did contact lens fittings at that location. I have never heard of an eye doctor's office that does not provide contacts prescriptions. I was quite unhappy, especially since no one had bothered to mention this when I booked an appointment. In light of having taken time off of work only to need a second appointment elsewhere, I decided to make the most of the visit and get my glasses prescription updated. Dr. Lee came in and quickly looked at me (although I waited a while as he was not even in the office at the time of my appointment), and then left. When I checked out, the office staff attempted to get me to book an appointment at their Henderson location to get my contacts updated. I declined. I went elsewhere and spent a significant amount of money buying a few pairs of glasses with my updated prescription. While I could see, I felt like my night vision was different than it had been with my last pair of glasses. However, I couldn't imagine how that could be possible and tried to ignore the differences. Flash forward to today where I finally had an appointment elsewhere to take care of the contacts issue (Dr. Alissa Nagel and her staff at VisionWorks were pleasant, professional, and conducted the most thorough eye exam I have ever had). While there, they had me put on my glasses as a starting point for checking my prescription. Dr. Nagel quickly stated that my prescription seemed off and asked if I was having trouble seeing at night. Apparently, the prescription I was given does not properly account for my astigmatism, causing light to look different at night. So, in sum, Nevada Eye Physicians was once lovely, but my latest (and last) experience left me with 1) wasted time; 2) no contacts prescription; and 3) an incorrect glasses prescription, plus the bonus of knowing anyone can make an appointment and be treated without showing identification.

All we needed was a SIM card. It took 30 minutes for us to get waited on. We wanted to replace the iPhone 4 my wife had with an iPhone 5 our son had given her. The rep did not know what he was doing and wasn't really interested in helping us since we weren't making a purchase. After several minutes of conversation, I decided it would be best to backup the iPhone 4 at home since he said he couldnt help us do that. We paid a $20 service fee and went home. After serveral attempts online and an hour on the phone, the rep on the phone determined the store had sold us the wrong SIM card. He had one overnighted to us and it took 10 minutes to get it installed. I went back to the Pahrump store to return the SIM card for a refund. The store refused to refund the money. The clerk and the manager claimed it was a service fee and they could not refund service fees. I pointed out that I had not received the correct ""service"". They final word was they would not refund my money and I should leave their store. I will not return to this store. If you feel you must see and handle the product, go there for a demonstration and then order it by phone or online. Footnote: This happened in early November.

I am feeling so thankful that my community has Dr. Song as a dentist and feeling blessed that he & his office staff helped me to trust the process. From 1973 I have had teeth issues from an accident that left years of issues. All of my front teeth were about ready to fall out of my head literally. My adult children knew that i feared the possibility of dentures, fear of becoming that person who lives without teeth because they don't fit right, too big, hurt to much...whatever negative could be I thought or felt it. So scared of the not knowing and then trusting a dentist who wouldn't help or understand, not only with the teeth but with the emotions that would come with whatever work needed to be done. As I talked with my family they were beginning to see my teeth wiggle with every breath or word I spoke. One afternoon my son called and said mom I found this dentist on Yelp who I think you should go see. If you have to get dentures and you don't like them there are other options he offers like something called snap on dentures. Needless to say I went and it was literally life changing. From the first moment i walked in I felt at ease. His staff is absolutely amazing (especially Andrea) and very welcoming. Doctor Song came in after the X-rays and said I would need dentures. He told me what the process would be...explained that it would take some getting use to, but he would help me and he would explain everything as we went through the process. Without the risk of writing a book, I want you to know that Doctor Song is AMAZING. Everything he does within his practice is so professional but he also truly understands that there is a person who has fears and emotions connected to these teeth. He makes the whole process so simple. I want you to know that he was so gentle that even after 3 sets of impressions, I didnt lose any of my front teeth! I recommend anyone and everyone to Dr Song, he is truly phenomenal an artist in his profession and I am so appreciative to have him as my dentist. And my new teeth make me feel better then I have ever felt. Tears Doctor Song!!

So my comments here or not consistent with my overall experience with Enterprise. OK here's the bad news. We do an annual golf trip every year and rent from the enterprise location at McCarran international airport in Las Vegas and return the vehicle to the same place. We rent a vehicle for one week. We received the wrong vehicle to start. Every year we rent a suburban which fits our needs. So the Ford that we received was not only damaged but smelled horrible and had the left quarter panel Almost hanging off. We noted this with video and pictures while standing in front of the agent. This really put a damper in my confidence that Enterprise is really looking after customer service. The guys were not happy about driving in this car and not only did he have damage but it smelled inside. When I asked the agent for the suburban that we reserved he said this is a better choice and your suburban would take two or three hours to get cleaned up. We were on a tight schedule so we were forced to take this vehicle.

I was a fool to believe the rest of my meal was going to be as pleasant. I ordered the rib eye medium rare. The knife provided was closer to a butter knife than a steak knife. Unsharp and barely serrated, I worked on my ungodly gristly steak with it as I balanced on the edge of my unreclining La-Z-Boy.

We ordered a large iconic 5th wheel toy hauler with all the specs we liked and put almost $5 thousand down on the unit. After 6 and a half months of waiting and multiple calls both to this dealership and their manufacture (eclipse rv) i find out that eclipse rv discontinued the model we ordered and the new model is going to be a couple thousand more, granted the new model does have a few more features but i feel they should have fulfilled our order first especially after $5k down. After calling countless times with no information on new model pricing and everyone taking the ""head in sand approach"".. talking to all 3 eclipse rv sales managers and getting vague answers on easy questions like ""what are the new model interior color schemes?"" Each of the 3 eclipse rv sales managers tell me different pricing but all say no more than $3 thousand increase in price. Finally i get a call from Austin with western skies and he says they should start building it in about 2 weeks and it's going to be $6 grand more for a total price of about $59723.58(out the door). I told him that's way more than what eclpise told me and my absolute max that I'll pay is $3k more and he tells me the BS response that he's actually losing money on the deal..first of all.. who comes up with an even number of $6 thousand more? You'd think it would be like $2637.65 or something especially since western skies told me that he talked to eclipse rv and they were just going to charge me the cost difference between the two models..secondly, he's telling me that he's losing money on this deal when we are $3 grand away on a 60k trailer?? Lies.... needless to say Austin was ""willing"" to give me my deposit back and i told him expect an appropriate review.. Now to be fair when i put a deposit down he did warn me that there is a possibility of some color changes and ""rarely make slight changes to units in order to facilitate a smoother switch before the next model year"" his words.

110032112774026366990,Kristin Bleich,2018-08-09 18:40:00,3.0,"I am extremely frustrated with Ford at this point. My car would not start on Wednesday night, I got it jumped and drove home, knowing that I would either need a jump or a tow in the morning. Thursday morning, I called the Ford roadside for a jump, giving myself plenty of time to drop it off at Ford and get to work. After originally having an ETA of 8:24, then me calling the service provider, and them saying 20 minutes, then calling AGAIN at 9:15, when they should have been there 50+ minutes before that, and they told me ANOTHER 30 minutes, I had to cancel. I was already late to work and decided to just have it towed in to Ford. I had the request for a tow started at 9:15, and an ETA of 90 minutes. Not a big deal, I was at work anyways. I went on my first break around 11:15 and they still hadn't gotten my car. It took them another 90 minutes to even get it in to Ford. Understandably, when Ford got my car, I figured they would have it through Friday, at the latest. I have gotten very little updates regarding my car, aside from the fact that it needed a new battery. I'm reasonable and I understand that things take time, but this is incredibly frustrating and extremely unacceptable. It's already midway through Saturday and I haven't had any updates about my car in over 24 hours, despite reaching out to the service writer. I am extremely disappointed as I've never had any issues with the service department, or Ford itself. EDIT: I called Ford regarding my car around 4pm to be told that my car was done, but yet I still hadn't received ANY call regarding it. The lady over the phone told me that they closed at 5 and I would need to come down before then, otherwise I would have to wait until Monday. After processing the paperwork (and finding out it was only the battery that was changed), I asked a service writer how long it should take to change the battery (half a day is what she told me.) I told her I didn't understand why it had been 2+ days that they had had my car. She took me to the manager, Rachel. Rachel, while super nice, tried to be helpful. They explained to me that the gentleman that usually does the batteries had to leave early yesterday (not my fault?). The manager and the other service writer then explained (after i told them my frustrations with the gentleman that I had been dealing with), that he was new and had only been there a week. Rachel then explained that her hands were tied and they could either give me a free tank of gas, or free detailing on my next visit (because I'm such a loyal customer!). Feeling a little bit defeated, I just took the free detailing. I find myself to be pretty reasonable and patient, but to have to wait as long as I did for a simple battery change and oil change, I'm still extremely frustrated. Edit (8/9): Ford reached out to me regarding my frustrations, and while it was resolved, mostly. I still think it was handled incorrectly to begin with.",0x80c8eb0fffc75cd9:0xd2d3fb7dbfaee341,Team Ford Lincoln,36.2585267,-115.248296,"['Ford dealer', 'Auto parts store', 'Lincoln dealer', 'Truck dealer', 'Used car dealer']",4.3,1101,irrelevant

Service: Party of five and it was tough to find a seat because they were busy. A host informed us that if we wanted a table that it would require a two drink minimum per person which we were fine with. One of my friends doesn't drink so I had to step it up. A server would stop by about every 15 minutes to check up on us. It's a small lounge so it was easy to wave her down if we need anything. The DJ was firing classic dance music from the 90s to present day. There are no tables in front of him so it's an unofficial/official dance floor. People were getting their groove on throughout the night. The music is loud so you're going to have to speak up considerably to get your game/convo on. Ambiance: The bar is so long it almost extends the whole back wall. They carry all top shelf booze and they were staffed with plenty of bartenders to keep the drinks flowing. Regular Vegas Strip bar pricing at $15+ per cocktail. Dim lighting and dark wood make for a very attractive and classy vibe in this lounge. The staff are all dressed sharply in dark formal wear. If the DJ isn't there giving the party vibe, it appears it can be a quiet place to grab cocktails on a date or catch up with friends. Whether I'm here for loud or quiet drinks, this is a very attractive lounge that I'll visit again when I'm at Park MGM.

Setting: I have been here during its grand opening and have returned for its re-grand opening. The decor of the restaurant has been updated with an improved layout to the sauce station. Previously the sauce station was on what looked like a plastic wedding cake design now in a more buffet style, but is a bit cramp as many diners will be all over experimenting with sauces and other additions. The party area does boast individual hot pot stoves for large parties and a large stove in the middle for the larger broth option. Service: Pretty typical but it was a busy Saturday night, we seem to have three different servers tending to our tables. Drinks were a tad slow but nothing to lose yourself over. Food: The oxtail broth, new cuts of meat, add new items on the conveyor belt (chicken feet, enoki mushrooms wrapped in bacon). Being a big oxtail fan, I chose the oxtail broth which was... a bit bland. The sauce station helped play a nice role as I experimented with my broth by adding spicy, salty, bitter, sweet etc... till it matched exactly what I wanted. Wagyu was beautifully marbled with a nice chewy but not so melt in your mouth texture. Personal Choice: Tomato broth and the spicy broth are great! Brisket Wagyu Beef side of enoki rice. Bam!

They never work with me on anything. From the very start, they couldn't meet me at the place I was renting, I had to go to the other side of town, get the keys, leave a deposit go check out the place, and all within their business hours. This was just a huge pain (at the time I worked during their business hours, so I had to take time off work to accommodate them). Then they charged me more than what was listed for the pet deposit... whatever... I paid it. Then they sent out an email asking if they could remove some garbage cans from our property, I replied to the email saying I would like to keep my garbage can, and a week later, only my garbage can was gone. It takes way too long to get things fixed, I reported issues and the landlord came over, brought the things to fix the issues, and then just stored them in my house they have been sitting there for a year now. When I renewed my lease, I asked them if those things could be fixed, especially since rent was increasing, they said yes but then nothing ever came of it. I asked for a parcel box so I could receive packages so the homeless people who live behind our unit don't steal them they told me to get a PO box because they are unwilling to provide a box for packages. Bottom line, there is zero customer service. You pay them, you can live there. But don't expect your property to be maintained, or things to be fixed. You will have to constantly hound them if you want something done. You will always have to leave a message and response times can vary between a couple days or a couple weeks. I feel like as a customer it's their job to provide service and they simply don't. They will nickel and dime you at every junction. It's all about the money not community relationships or unit management. I've been living in my unit for about a year and a half now and if it wasn't so hard to find somewhere else in Reno I would have left by now because I just hate the interaction I have with them. I feel like a money cow to them and nothing else. Bare minimum. They could improve this. They could follow up on service request. They could answer calls. They could respect your wishes when they ask to do something and you say no. They could meet you half way on improvements. They could check in and see if people are satisfied after work has been ""completed"". And a big one, they could give us a freaking parcel box. Other things that would help would be doing a little extra when working with residents or potential residents. Things like, meeting folks at the potential property you know, answer questions, address concerns and issues together. They could be timelier in request for repairs.

They have a special room for vintage games and then the more recent games are out front stacked practically to the ceilings and they have so much variety from just dance to the sims four. The staff are nice and there is great customer service and are always willing to help! They also can do repairs which as an added bonus. It's a one stop shop for all you're gaming needs and it just has a lot more of a welcoming environment than some competitors like GameStop.

The drink specials were great and the food was wonderful. This led to us going back that evening for a late dinner. Unfortunately the service was so bad it almost ruined our evening. I don't recall the servers name but he had a distinct look with a mustache curled at each side. He approached the table with a very poor attitude. ""What do you guys want No hello I am xxxx what would you ladies like. When we asked about dinner specials his response was no we don't have that. One of the ladies asked about crab cakes or rolls which were plainly identified on the menu which he stated they didn't serve. At this point we all felt as though he did not want to wait on us. When one of the ladies asked another server who the manager was. The manager politely came over to our table. We didn't want to complain prior to our food being served for fear of what he might do to it. He noticed the manager at our table and his attitude promptly changed. I typically am not the person to immediately jump to conclusions but I genuinely feel he did not want to serve our table because we were women of color. I hope that Ocean One Bar will take this review seriously and address the waiter. Again we were at your restaurant Saturday night around 9 PM and we sat at the booth directly near the hostess stand.

When they first opened, the luxury was phenomenal with comfortable seats, great food options, a nice bar, and in-theater waiting service. All of this made it worth the extra money to see a movie there...although in the beginning, the movie options weren't the greatest. Today, the movie options have improved, but we have lost a lot of what made this theater better than the rest. The prices of tickets and food/beverages have increased, while the quality of food, amount of food options, and number of staff has gone way down. You have to wait in line forever to order your food or drinks and food prep takes forever because of the lack of staff. Each day I have gone I have been told they no longer offer in-theater waiting service on that particular day (no matter what day of the week it is). Sometimes there is a ticket taker, sometimes the bartender does it, sometimes we are on our own to scan our tickets with a device. Why am I purchasing expensive tickets for my family while it would be so easy to just walk in to any theater and hope I grab an open seat? Your level of service and appeal are dwindling, making you just another theater like the rest. Please, please bring back what made you guys stand out: great food options (not regular movie food), in-theater waiting service, and more staff in the lobby. Three stars because the theater is beautiful and always clean.

My server was pretty good, the food is definitely not cheap, but typical for this type of restaurant. My meal with my daughter (one combo plate, a kids meal, iced tea, juice, and a terrible dessert) was about $55. Anyway, I saw ""fried ice cream"" on the menu and usually this is a mexican favorite so I paid the $8.50 for my daughter to have it, expecting something of decent quality. TERRIBLE! Their version is simply vanilla ice cream with soggy cereal (fruity pebbles) sprinkled on top and a ton of weird, old tasting whipped cream. My daughter took one or two bites and wouldn't touch it again. I tried to take a few bites, but it was so bad. I mentioned to the hostess that something seemed wrong and she just shrugged it off saying that's just how it is, so she didn't seem concerned. I still think something was wrong, but we'll never know. Totally ruined what would have been a decent visit. Now, we are left with that as our lasting impression so we won't be rushing back any time soon. If you give them a try, do NOT order that disgusting ""fried"" ice cream!",0x80c8cffc0c04fff9:0xb9d203644e6d2a3e,Casa Don Juan,36.0723533,-115.0997238,"['Mexican restaurant', 'Bar', 'Lounge']",4.5,1398,relevant

Sadly, he caused leaks in our roof which caused us to have to refelt that part of the roof. So I went shopping for a new vendor. Based on many great reviews and great sales presentation, I settled on Celestial. I liked the looks of their system that was much better than the one we had. We installed the same number of panels. Mike and Saul installed the system and Mike did an excellent job resetting our Aqualink. We turned it on July 3 when the pool was 80 at 10 o'clock. We limit the temperature to 89 and we were pleased to see that the pool reached 89 by 2 o'clock faster than the older one.

I can always tell whether thai is authentic by the mushrooms dead giveaway. HOWEVER I will not judge the entire meal based on this & I've still had delicious thai despite this. First off the egg rolls were SO mushy & soggy inside & had a really strange after taste, so unfortunately I didn't enjoy these at all. The soup was WAY too sour, to the point where you can't even taste anything BUT the lemongrass. I hate when they do this because it throws the entire ingredients off & just RUINS the soup! The chow mein wasn't bad but definitely lacked flavor. But the most annoying thing wasn't even the food, it was the lady at the counter. I asked her if there was any way she could offer a discount or make something ELSE for me since I didn't even EAT my soup or egg rolls, to which she replied, ""No."" No apology WHAT-SO-EVER, just a flat, emotionless ""NO."" I was beyond irritated at that point because they didn't care whatsoever about making their customers happy as long as they get their MONEY! I also found it funny cause there were people there saying this was the ""best thai in town""... & I thought how the heck would you know unless you've tried every single thai place in town?

I called asking her about the 50% off party packages they were advertising; for her to say she will see into that and hung up on me. I called back and she acted as if it wasn't her who I had spoken with. She responded by saying there are a lot of employees, it could have been anyone. (Mind you, I called as soon as it opened at 10am, so there aren't even that many customers to which they need that many employees, but that's besides the point) She finally answered my initial question that they don't have that offer anywhere. Which I told her I actually screenshot it. She said her manager was right next to her and said the same thing. She asked me exactly where that deal was, which I told her several times it was on their Facebook page. She then starts telling me in a rude manner other options I have, either Groupon or their actual packages in store. I replied with why they have that promotion and to call now for that deal if they won't honor it. If this incident happened with just a phone call, imagine if I actually book them for my son's party. Very unprofessional and a lying company. I will make sure to tell all the people I know to never step foot there or book any party. Thank you Get Air for proving to me you are not worth our time and money. Your loss! At least LOL Kids Club is around the corner and my son's bday party their last year was a blast! I highly recommend that place. Update 04/29/18: Chad has gone above and beyond in accommodating my son's bday birthday that is coming up soon. I may have had a bad experience with the corporate office but Chad the owner has far surpassed all of that and found an awesome solution. I can't wait for my son's 6th birthday party now!!! Update 05/31/2018: My Son's birthday party was this past Sunday, May 27th, and I am truly in love with this facility. We've been to several different trampoline parks and by far this was has been the most accommodating and amazing experience we've had. I truly appreciate Chad, Seth, and Damon for going above and beyond in making my son's birthday party the best of all years!!! A total of 21 kids attended my son's party with 3 hours of fun. Even the parents loved it and want their kids' birthday party there as well. We CANNOT thank you guys enough for your patience, selflessness, and most of all your support.

Thanks to the exotic car rental in Las Vegas, I was able to fulfill a dream that I always had, to drive an exotic car; to be more exact, a Lamborghini. On top of all this, they have the best prices and customer service! And being honest, it took me a lot to go to their company and receive the car, so they explained to me that they could deliver it to my house; thanks to this I was able to enjoy it without any problem. Since I contacted them through their website, the site gave me enormous confidence as they explain all their questions in detail. When I finally decided on the car I wanted to rent, I called them and they made me feel the best, as I said, they have the best customer service. Thanks to all this I was able to make a dream come true, perhaps, if this company did not exist I would never have driven a lambo; this experience finally inspires me to work very hard hoping to be the owner of an exotic car.

We decided to go the sharable bites route and ordered a whole bunch of menu items such as the crispy cauliflower (vegan), Catch Roll, Mango Shrimp Roll, Vegetable King Roll (vegan) with ponzu sauce, Cod Lettuce Wraps, Lobster Rolls, Roasted Spaghetti (vegan), Crispy Brussel Sprouts (vegan), Parmesan-Truffle Fries (vegan) and for dessert, we had their signature ""Hit Me"" cake and the vegan pistachio cheesecake (so good!). From the list, I definitely recommend the vegan crispy cauliflower! One of the best items on the menu! The Roasted Spaghetti was a bit too salty for me and the Brussel Sprouts a bit too oily. The vegan pistachio cheesecake was so delicious, it was paired with vanilla sorbet.",0x80c8c5c19d130acd:0x3c21d17be20c58ce,CATCH,36.1073485,-115.1765836,"['Seafood restaurant', 'Asian fusion restaurant', 'Asian restaurant', 'Steak house', 'Sushi restaurant']",4.2,396,relevant

116968238790810881412,Food Guru,2020-11-11 07:33:20,2.0,Dr Cutter struggles with making level and good bonded fills and she does not take criticism well instead she will ask you to find a new dentist. Dr Cutter believes her fillings should only last several months when really composite fillings should last years. I had 11 fillings done with Dr Cutter. Out of the 11 fills nearly 5 of those fillings fell out. 2 out of the 5 composite fills that fell out were replaced on two and three separate occasions. 6 or 7 of the 11 fills protruded beyond the tooth structure leaving me in a awkward position asking her to polish and bring them down to my actual tooth level. She seemed agitated and annoyed when I asked her to do better work. Further wondering why she didn't just do a good job the first time. She replaced a poor filling she did on my first molar that fell out since she messed up so bad she then explained to me that I will need a crown if her fill doesn't last. So that tooth that only needed a filling will need a crown if her sketchy filling doesn't hold. Yay I love loosing a molar due to poor dental work. Dr Cutter left many of my fillings that she performed uneven and protruding beyond my tooth structure. She continued to deny her poor work and continue to express to me that I was the problem and her failing and uneven fillings she had performed were somehow my fault. She did attempt to correct her work after I had to remind her over and over again the importance of creating flush and even fillings. After expressing frustration with her work due to so many appts needing to be made in attempts to correct her work she then told me the fillings she performed several months earlier were not her problem. She likes to leave copious amounts of composite filling overhangs in random places throughout her fillings because she doesn't believe some patients are worth that 5-star work. She also told me not to come back because I asked her if she felt confident enough in her work to have it checked by another dentist. Since I was loosing faith in her work. Beware she doesn't take her time and she will deny her poor work and will continuously shift blame on the patient. It's petty and poor behavior of any doctor instead of just listening to your patients you have to rebuttal and guard your frail ego. Your patient is upset with your poor work and your ego superseded the patients needs. I'm not even sure if the composite fillings she did perform were done correctly. I will have to see another dentist to find out the severity of damage that may have been left by her. I just don't understand why we have to deal with bad dental work within the 21st century. I also don't understand why a dentist would want to even cause their patients to suffer with poor work. Why do we have to correct our dentists? Why can't we get safe and effective work here? I asked her how can you perform a root canal and crown build up when you can't even do a proper 3 surface composite fill appropriately? Be careful guys she's just one out of many dentists who don't care about her patients. Instead she will give you work she thinks you deserve and in my case she believed I wasn't worth 5-star work.,0x80c8c6d41aaa38dd:0x73b45c40a52f2623,Budget Dental,36.1260519,-115.2311306,"['Dentist', 'Cosmetic dentist', 'Dental clinic']",4.7,338,relevant

We went in to ask about having a brand new AT&T card activated for my boyfriends cell phone and possibly buy a new TV stand. Since the sim card was already in his phone the first girl that helped us said that the sim card itself had to be purchased at their store or they could not activate it. Next we asked if someone else could possibly help because we have had the this done before at other locations. We waited almost 30 minutes which was no big deal as we were shopping for a new TV stand as well. The girl who helped us initially made it seem like her co worker or manager could activate the sim card for us as it took so damn long for him to even come out to the sales floor to help us.

With the exception of an idiot cowboy who liked to fire his gun within close proximity to ear drums the staff seemed great. I do not recommend the Saloon for families or anyone. There are pornographic pictures of women on the walls. Filthy, Filthy, Filthy. There is a lot of negativity around the complex. Signs that keep reminding you how they can refuse you service at anytime, ""do not take pictures"", ""what part of no pictures don't you understand"", ""warning you will be towed for parking in employee parking area"". The main complaint would be the carpet in the rooms and the dog smell. The sofas could use replacing as well. It would also be nice if you didn't have to smell cigarettes Everytime you entered the front office. Because of the location of the motel, the internet was spotty at best.

The flight itself was good but very disappointed by the customer service. The transfer to their site missed me at the hotel and didn't bother calling the correct mobile number I'd e-mailed them the previous day to check where I was (they called my UK number which wasn't active). I was standing about 10 feet away from where I apparently should have been standing. I called the company to ask where they were and was told to get a cab to their site which I would have pay for or i'll miss the flight. They didn't offer to pay for the cab and refused to reimburse the fare. They also refused to accept responsibility for the mistake. I generally don't have high expectations but this is not how I run my company. It would have cost them just $12 to offer to pay for my cab and would have prevented a very stressful 30 minutes before departure (with two young children) which nearly ruined the trip. The error was clearly Maverick's as I had a reply from my e-mail updating my mobile phone number.

100518486348831120445,Christina Hwang,2019-05-30 12:40:00,5.0,"So I'm going to be completely honest here. I have tried so many nail salons in Vegas..it's insane... I love getting nails..but it has turned into such a nerve-wracking stressful experience from all the horrible customer service... the quality of the nails....etc. I really was about to give up...but driving home I saw Paris nails...and it's super close to where I live..so I decided to give it a shot. Going in, I had a new set of acrylic nails that I only got ONE month ago..... They were ombre, coffin acrylics. I got them from shimmer nails.. (Close to where I live as well) TWO nails popped off the second week after getting them..mind you, I don't do any hard physical labor or anything. I'm sorry, but that place is just horrible. I didn't get greeted..I had to wait when I had an appointment... the workers treated me like they didn't want me there and yeah, the actual nails were horrific... I also got a pedi..and when I came home I took it off and did it myself..I was so upset.... & that is exactly why I was about to just give up! but THANK GOD I FOUND THIS PLACE. I'll admit..I was hesitant at first...I looked them up here on google..there weren't many reviews..so I knew that they were pretty new... but them being a new salon doesn't say anything about their customer service, and their dedication towards making sure everything they do is absolute PERFECTION. I walked in, was greeted...she was so sweet and nice...helped me choose what kinds of colors and designs I wanted.. I decided to go with ombre again...but this time two fingers with the marble design. I was looking at all the samples and wowwww, they specialize in so much cool stuff... all the cool hip nail stuff that's in right now? they can do! I sat..and she took off my nails. Again, she was the sweetest..she was so gentle...she carried conversation with me.. I was already so relieved and actually enjoyed myself for the first time in a long time at a nail salon. My boyfriend came with me, and she also made sure he was good and comfortable as well! After she was done, I sat where a tech named Henry was. Also very nice! and I just felt so relaxed and at ease. I was talking to him about how horrible my experience was at shimmer..and he assured me that he was going to make sure I love my nails and that I would walk out happy... He started working..and already I could tell such a huge difference from how he worked to the multiple other places I've been too. HE WAS A PERFECTIONIST. He didn't stop filing..drilling...etc until it looked immaculate. he told me he had TWENTY YEARS of experience... And IT SHOWED. I have lived in Vegas all my life..& I've never been so happy with the outcome of my nails. He did so good, I was literally about to cry lol my boyfriend even noticed the huge difference! lol I finally found a place that didn't make me feel uncomfortable..had amazing customer service AND did a superb job on my nails. We all want those Instagram looking nails that cost like hundreds of dollars. Well, you can get them here for so much cheaper. Please don't deter from this place because they are new... I am confident that once you come in...you will keep coming back. Just like how I'm going to. I know we all search and search for the nail salon we love that we want to continue to go back to... We want to feel comfortable...become familiarized with the people who work there...& just be confident that you are going to love your nails... THIS IS THE PLACE. Thank you Paris Nails and Lashes.

There were amazing views a large and beautiful pool and water sports on the lake. The food was wonderful, for breakfast all kinds of fruit, delicious bread and croissants, all kinds of hot dishes and amazing omelettes. We were there in the slow season so most of the little shops were closed. They did have some delicious food and a great waitress in their restaurant. My biggest complaint with this beautiful place is I was traveling with two handicapped seniors and they had to walk forever to get to their rooms. I asked for rooms close to the elevator. We were traveling together and we're not even on the same floor and our rooms were very far from each other and the elevator. One night after finally getting to our room our door would not open. They sent a young man up and he told us we they would have to get a maintenance engineer to change the battery in the lock and it would take 15 to 20 minutes.

A special member was Patty CNA) who went Above and beyond in her care. Food was great and served by a wonderful staff. My husband was in another hospital in July this year and all I can say is he came out worse than when he went in. We were kind of Skeptical about going into a hospital again. 2 things I want to point out, not as criticism. 1. When being discharged we were told to go to discharge (office) to sign out. Our daughter was a little impatient of waiting for someone to bring a wheelchair, so she went and found one herself. Asked the nurse where the office was located. By the cafeteria she said. Well after searching for 20 minutes my daughter found someone who was kind enough to direct us to the office which is next to the Starbucks coffee. Now when you look at the door to the office there is a plaque on the (left) side that describe s it as a classroom and then there is a ""paper"" that say discharge office. Which one would u see? 2nd: my husband was evaluated by PT twice in the 4 days he was there. The first time I wasn't present. I was there the second time and the PT spent 20 minutes and that includes putting on my husbands shoes. He can't walk without shoes because he had a stoke and needs them to walk well. pT walked him about 15 feet, came back, put him in a chair and left. When the case worker came she said PT recommended a rehabilitation hosp for 2 weeks. We discussed this with her and gave her all the information about the equipment and devices we had at home to care for him to strengthen his gait and get him back to his full strength.

Not just in sales but in service too. When I can I get the oil changes and regular maintenance done there, I always feel like I am being treated fairly. Jason W has been my sales person these past 2 times. I leased a 2017 Honda Pilot from him 3 years ago. The sales experience was great and he called me once a year just to check in and see how I was doing and if I had any questions about the car. Then these past few months he called or texted just to check in as my lease was coming to an end. I went in last Monday to turn it in for a new lease. Jason found me exactly what I wanted and at the price I wanted. He spent time to show me the differences in the 2 models and helped me set everything up before I left. I was toying with the idea of getting a different brand car for several months before I turned this in. But my mind always went back to Honda- both because of my loyalty to Honda (this is my 6th Honda) and because of the wonderful experiences I always have at this dealership.

She was able to identify the loupes, track down a mount and send it to me. The Airlux light works, I'm on my third led light though since the connection gets finicky real quick and was told it was due to production issues during the period I got my first 2 led's. The third led light I'm using right now is starting to not act right but am reluctant to contact them yet again to experience the back and forth all over again.
