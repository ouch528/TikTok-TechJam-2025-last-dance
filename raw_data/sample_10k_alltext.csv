Diane was great but the one tech we used was very rude today and completely continued to pass over us at our appointment time and took others that came in after us. I don’t think we will be returning ever again. Very very upset. And disappointed in the way we were treated today.

The assistant manager still hasn't figured out how to wear his mask and they demand too much personal information that's not needed to actually make the sale.  It's a shame because they're pretty close to where I live, but I'll be going to Valvoline from now on for my oil changes.
I really went back and forth with this review.  When I got there nobody was wearing masks.  Not good.  Also the guy behind the counter immediately tried to upsell me.  Also not good.  But they did good work and the owner/manager (different guy than the one who signed me in maskless) took care of me in the end.  So I split the difference between the early bad service and better later service and am giving them a 3.  May give them another shot to see if they get their act together better.",,"{'time': 1601844492539, 'text': 'Your safety is our #1 priority.

The waiter Martha came in, very rude, she acted like doesn't want to serve me. She asked me what to drink. I wanted to have water. Then, she brought the water and just told me to keep looking the menu, until I serve other guests. Even though, I was already ready. I tried to tell her, but she completely ignored me, and left. Later when she came back, I told her I wanted to have Hot and Sour soup. The waiter Martha goes, it's not available, nothing available from Chinese by 12 am. The waiter Martha said that only five minutes are remaining till 12 am. I tried to explain her that I talked to the host. The host is the one who explained everything. She was like I am telling you that nothing from Chinese is available after 12 am, and it's only five minutes left from 12 am and we don't have any Chinese. The waiter Martha placed a hand on the menu on one side and stated you can look after these pages. The waiter literally placed her palm very loudly on one side of the menu and stated, do not look back behind these pages. She said, she's the waiter and she knows What's available and what is not. Then waiter Martha said I have to assist other guests, you keep looking up the menu going forward from these pages. Again, with loudly placed her palm on the menu, and she left to assist others. I was very upset with the insult, and just left the restaurant. This waiter's attitude is like the one who works on the street serving food. I don't think even food serving on a street even does like that. This waiter Martha should not be working big restaurant. The Strat Cafe is literally desperate to hire trash people like this waiter Martha. That's the reputation of The Strat Cafe. I will never recommend anyone to eat there.

The grilled bread that is served is difficult to eat.  Too chewy & thick.  Although the fresh oregano in the dipping olive oil is a nice touch, they would be better off infusing the olive oil and adding the fresh oregano as garnish.
The filet minion was poor quality (lacked proper marbaling).  Although it was prepared correctly.

She suffers from advanced Alzheimer’s disease, resides in a group and is very hard to transport. With the current Covid-19 restrictions, it’s a challenge to get  her into a doctor. Everyone I dealt with from the people on the phones and those who came to do her check up were great. Very responsive. They called me the day after her chest x-Ray (which they were able to order and so in her home), to give me the results. I highly recommend them and will definitely use them again!!!",,,0x80c8c15fb269d245:0x8ef08a4f763f4be3

He was diligent and pleasant and very very hard working.  It was a tough job, but he got it done.

We saw the sign that indicated Valet was closed but we were going to check in, drop off our luggage and then move the vehicle which was parked along the curb.  An employee approached us and rudely said, ""hey there is no valet and what...you think you can just park your car where ever you feel like???"" That's how they treat their guests apparently.

On to the room and the rest of our stay.  The hotel room for the price was horrible.  There was still crumbs on the floor from who ever stayed there before, the room features were really old, beds uncomfortable, pillows hard as a rock!  The doors are thin and do not give you a safe feeling.  I think the door knobs are original from the original build!  Nothing fancy by any means probably would have done better at Motel 6....

Everything is pretty much still closed, the restaurant choices are slim, no Buffets are open there.  The gaming tables are ridiculous..... lowest I found was $15 min for black jack and $25  min for craps!!!  This was during the day!  The $15 min goes away and right back to $25!  There was only ONE $15 min table available and there was plenty of people waiting to get on that table (only 3 people allowed at a table at a time)  It was so boring and just DEAD!  Not once did I see anyone cleaning/wiping down surfaces due to COVID-19

We left for dinner found that the Atlantis had buffet open!  That buffet was amazing (steak/seafood night)  They had it together over there, temperature taken at the door, very nice employees, people having fun, it was how it should be!  They had more slots available it was clean (I saw employees cleaning and wiping down the slot machines) They had the plexiglass partitions up on the game tables and slots.

Though you can go casual, just as many were dressed up.  Got to love a place that has racks of lovely dry aging steaks on display.  Went with the Cowboy Rib-eye, medium rare.  It's bone in, and was juicy and flavorful.  Chose the Colossal Baked Potato as a side.  It's huge,  easily two can share it.  Same with the Ceasar Salad.  We shared one and that was perfect.

Our waitress came by half hour into our wait and said, we’ll have your pizza right out. She didn’t come by again. Literally saw a couple come in after us, have a leisurely drink at the bar, order food about 20 minutes after us, got their food for themselves and another couple they met up with, eat and pay. My husband asked the waitress at the cash at this point when our pizza was coming. She looked over at me and my toddler like she completely forgot we were there. She acted like no big deal, and disappeared. At this point an hour had gone by since we ordered.
About 8:15 my toddler started tantruming, she was starving and it was about her bed time. I told my husband let’s go, and I stood up and packed up. I waved her down. I asked if they forgot our order. She got cold and told me it was simply missed. I told her this is ridiculous, we’ve been waiting over an hour, the people behind us have ordered and eaten. I said forget it, we’re going. She said are you sure? It’s really almost done. I said how much longer? She told me two minutes. I said I’m really angry, I don’t think this is worth it. She assured us it would be out in 2 minutes. 10 minutes later she hadn’t returned and was nowhere to be seen. We walked out without our pizza, none of us having eaten, at 8:25. We left cash for my husband’s beer, but we shouldn’t have had to pay for any of this. Seriously the most terrible service.
At least apologize if you miss an order for an hour and a half - and certainly don’t lie about it and pretend it’s coming. Let people know, especially if they have small children, so they can leave and go elsewhere. At that time of night everything was closing up and we came home to eat turkey sandwiches on the one night a week we get to go out as a family.

I live on the other side of boulder highway next to the Wildfire, the trail leads all the way to gibson rd. If you can handle the journey take the hike, because when you get there, the AC hits you, the smell of bud in the air, smiles from the receptionist makes you feel welcome then the walk through the door and it feels like entering heaven, the shelves stocked with various kinds of bud from flower to concentrates, prerolls for those who don't have the time or skill to roll, edibles of different delights. Budtenders always helpful for those who are new to bud or those used to the old ways of buying ganja. Loyalty points is ok, got my first grinder I still have to this day from it.
I recommend Space ghost OG, if available.

No credit or debit cards, but ATMs available with a fee to use.  Those with Medical Cards have their own line and more selections, but selections are still great with Recreational.

Bowls, bongs, joint wraps, joint filters, wicks, etc are available.

For those with culinary skill can buy Baker Batches, to make your own edibles. Not for smoking, was wondering why an ounce was very cheap LOL.

For those into dabs, as I said there are concentrates, also wax, and shatter. There are also weed pens, and those capsule thingies for them for your vape or pen. Ask a budtender for more information on that.

Tax are meh, make sure you ask for the receipt first, tendency to put in the bag and seal it.
For those with social anxiety like myself, it can be pretty nerve wracking for first timers, I recommend CBD  to calm nerves or to stop a bad acid trip.

Military discount is available check the website for more information.

In summary a great place for Henderson Locals, must be 21+, great bud selection, budtenders are of great assistance. If problems arise, they will assist you to their best abilities. Also preordering is available, that can be a hassle. For those walk the railroad trail best of luck, I can no longer do it anymore. Going to Shango until a dispensary opens for the other side of Henderson. Hoping it be The Dispensary.",,"{'time': 1537630356779, 'text': 'Thanks, Darian, for that great review!

It would have been Better to receive  a text/or call regarding this. OrI have come to pick up more than one refill and told that pharmacy could not fill it because insurance wants mail order.

Celebrated our wedding anniversary and it was the best time. The interior is wild but in the best way possible. So many textures and finishes, I was in love. The cutlery was cute and plates were mismatched. Our cocktails were tasty. We had a gin and rum one where it came in a round flask like presentation and was essentially worth 2 cocktails.

The music was lively and the performers were entertaining and inclusive of the diners. There were lovely jazz singers, a very young and talented breakdancer, and a tap performer. Performances every 20 min or so, so we could focus on our meal / selves. Timing war done very well. The staff, every single person, was courteous and professional. Dirty plates and utensils were replaced without us requesting. We were checked in on. Dishes were explained as they were set down. We were asked politely whenever a plate was cleared.

The food! Yum!! Herb biscuits were easy and fresh. Shrimp cocktail had a fun lime foam...it was very refreshing though I am a purist and love cocktail sauce with my cocktail shrimp. Crab Louie was excellent...lots going on but all very well together. Short rib stroganoff was EXCELLENT: Tender and hefty cut of meat, super tasty sauce and mushrooms and fun little sheet of semolina. We had the roasted chicken with pesto which was not a favorite but we appreciated the tenderness of it... (The other main courses sounded heavy to accompany everything else we were having and I don't eat fish). To end we had the coconut Panna cotta with pineapple sherbet...while the chocolate terranium was an impressive presentation, we opted for lighter and it was a winner. So refreshing and the coconut was not overwhelming at all. I definitely ending on this note. Overall everything was beautifully presented, flavors were harmonized and nothing was overly salted or cooked.

Yes, they had a LOT of chocolate, M&M's  and all the standard candy you can find at any store but, the 1 Hershey's candy that is new and difficult to find in my local store, was glaringly absent from the store!! There wasn't even a space for Hershey's Chocolate covered Caramel Squares, Milk & Dark Chocolate!! When I asked one of the employees about the candy, she glared at me and said ""Isn't this enough for you?""  RUDE!!!  Had a Milk Shake here, it tasted like slightly melted ice cream with flavored syrup dumped in. Not mixed, just dumped into glass so, every once in a while, you got a big gulp of syrup flavor.  Bought store made  ""S'more"".  Marshmallow and the melted chocolate tasted OK, but the Graham cookie has a burnt taste making the complete ""S'more cookie"" taste disgusting!  I pulled the Graham off & threw away.  If I had a choice of going to this Hershey Store or the Dentist, I would choose the Dentist!!",,,0x80c8c4332e598b2d:0x9182a78eb66986e1

We go there for the turkey meat tacos, bean and cheese burritos and fish tacos which are all offered as buy one get one free if you have the coupons that come in the mail. I think they're found in the Sunday paper too.
Can't think of any negatives if you keep expectations in line and don't expect anything above a chain Mex store. Watch out for the multilayered veggie burrito though as I got sick on them twice, but I have a kinda sensitive stomach.

It was really cool and gave a pretty detailed about the start of the mobs, but it would have been nice to see how they transitioned from bootlegging to drugs and what all that had with it. But still, there are way more to mobs than Al Capone  and Chicago. Not to mention the historical value of the building and the location just made it all that much cooler. I would have liked to see more detail about the mob connections to Las Vegas, but really it shined a light on skimming and Howard Hughes. The main floor really was nifty how it trasnitioned from old mob to new mob tactics and issues. The interactive exihits were detailed and had great info and entertaining. We really wanted to do the interactive experience but it was booked out full. The basement did have a few little posters and info, otherwise I thinknit was just a bar situation thing or tasting.

I bought a cartridge (1g brass knuckles) for $80 plus tax and the product was nasty / defective and they refused to exchange it for me and said I can have 10% off a new one if I wanted. (What a joke)

I also had all my customer rewards points taken from me when they made the change over months ago and they didn’t do anything about that either and I still came back, but NEVER AGAIN will I come back there.

The worst part about this is that the sales lady somehow convinced me to buy the brass knuckles instead of the  “W”  that I always buy and told me how good it was and that I’ll be saving money as well. It was the worst decision I made.

Baby Birds Service & ambiance:  You put in your order and the staff brings your dish to your table.  All the staff we came across were friendly during our visit.  There's plenty of mobile tables and chairs  throughout the open dining area. Neutral colors are utilized well and there's a nice view of the lake with the massive houses by the shore.  There's plenty of flowers, potted and bedded plants, and indoor foliage to provide a gorgeous dining area. For a small cafe, Baby Birds maximizes the beauty and decor in a smart and efficient manner. Your social media fans will love your posts.

Baby Birds Cuisine:  We enjoyed everything we ordered.  My berry farm acai bowl was prepped well and tasty.  The bff's Baby Birds salad was gorgeous to look at and was delish in taste.  Their avocado toast was fantastic:  The generous piece of toast came out warm, the poached egg yolk was on point, and they were extremely generous with spinach side salad that accompanied the toast.  Carrots, tomatoes, edible flowers, radishes, etc are used to enhance the healthiness and prettiness of their dishes.  They really take the time to prep your dish for maximum taste as well as visually appealing.  Each dish is edible art in motion.  Very impressive.

I was really blown away by the pretty savory offerings at Baby Birds.  The location is off the beaten path but they're going to get popular quickly because they offer a great experience all around.  Next time I'm on this side of town I'll be back to try more dishes.  Enjoy!",,,0x80c8bf788e23912b:0x2b28aa7afe4c5b04

Once they had filtered through the applications I got a message saying I was chosen to adopt Ren and made an appointment for the upcoming Saturday morning. The process was thorough, they let me know all the critical details about my new baby and provided a schedule for his upcoming vaccinations. I cannot thank them enough for everything.

Didnt end up going with them because after waiting a hour for them they called saying if I still wanted a tow and that they were still 30 min away. I said yes and the lady on the phone then ask if keys were with truck. I preceded to explain its a classic car thats being restored and it didn't need a key to be put into neutral. She then explained she was going to charge 20 extra  for no key. with no reasonable explanation to why she needed to charge me . I refused and used a different tow company. This was the only tow company that has this outrageous charge. Don't use if you moving a roller with engine and no key Ignition installed look elsewhere.

I was adamant about the adjoining rooms and was assured that the notes were placed and the rooms reserved. Upon check-in, they assigned rooms on different floors. When I brought up my reservation, I was told they were booked and didn't have it available as requested. I was offered an option that wasn't as requested which didn't work.

Upon check-out, I expressed frustration and inquired why they did not have our reserved rooms, to which I was told they had to fix pipes in the room. I asked for a manager and was told a manger would call in 15 minutes.

About 2 hours later the manager called and I missed the call. He left a message stating that reservations don't guarantee a room, that all rooms are first come first serve and offered that io our next stay here would ensure that we get what we reserved.

I called him back, left a message stating that ""first come first served regardless of reservations"" is illogical and misleading when offering reservations and I requested a call back.  It has been four business days and I have not received a call back.

93610,106237523213822616894,Zak Burns,1559171422794,1.0,These guys got sent out because of a pipe issue in the front of my house. We have a home warranty so we do not have much control over who comes out. Unfortunately we got this company. The guy showed up and the box was full of water. He literally spent 30 seconds looking at it and then said it wouldn’t be covered by the warranty and that it would be around 2000 dollars to fix because the leak was coming from further down the line and they would have to dig up a bunch of the front yard. After he left I took a cup and emptied out the box in the front yard. Much to my surprise they leak was right there at the meter. I called back and they said the tech would come back out later that day. He never showed up. I called back that afternoon to find they close early on Saturdays and I was out of luck. I had no choice but to call another company who showed up and fixed the leak in under an hour and did not charge anywhere near 2000 dollars shockingly enough. Unfortunately I lost my 75 dollar deductible and apparently that tech got paid for 2 minutes of work. Worst service I have had in a long long time.,,"{'time': 1575926913060, 'text': ""We appreciate you as a customer Zak and we do also appreciate your feedback.

In this particular corner of Paradise I have the choice of five other Indian restaurants equidistant to me, but this is the one I always end up coming back to. Highlights: perhaps the best, richest Mango Lassi I have ever tried in my life; extraordinarily hearty entrees, of which the saag paneer is my personal favorite; and the delicious paneer pakora appetizer with just the slightest bit of mint chutney in the middle. The buffet is absolutely the best bargain, and while it is a dollar or two pricier than other buffets it is the only place I've been where the buffet food is on par with the dinner fare, and not a substandard version thereof .

17754,112779707704413365584,Crystal Schulz Home Loans,1592428376214,1.0,"Sadly, I have to write this tragic review. My 8 year old and I decided we would get two white kittens for our home. We were connected with Lillian who was fostering the kittens and started to visit them weekly in March. We were told they would not be ready until late June but loved them so much we decided to wait. We have one current cat, a senior dog, and a few hamsters, which were all indicated in the initial application to adopt the kittens.
We were asked to make weekly visits to Lillian's around her schedule which was nice enough but going there was awful as she is incredibly rude, and very abrasive to my daughter. June 15th... We are coming up on when I was told the kittens would be ready and I am told multiple times she needs to do my home visit. I have welcomed her openly to my home since April,  which is 5 minutes from hers but she has made alternate excuses more than 3 times. So I made time last night June 17th for her to come see the house. Prior to the visit I did get additional shots for my cat that she did not need and over $500 in new equipment for the kittens.
She came inside and although my home is shoe free she insisted on wearing her dirty sandals through. She was extremely rude and abrasive again, although I have complied with every request. She then tormented my dog who is literally dying of kidney failure with 2 unneeded strokes from around the back of his head; trying to provoke him. His toothless nipping at her in defense required her to state that if the dog did that to the kittens we cannot have them.... it was then I realized she was looking for a stupid excuse to not give us the kittens.
Today I took time off work to go to the house and do a dog greet. My dog was very nice to the kitten she brought and we again bonded with the kitten.
She then put the kitten into the crate, told me that she has a lot to think about, that she does not like my lifestyle, she does not feel comfortable giving us the kittens and then leaves....
leaves not just the kitten but two very broken hearts and a sobbing 8 year old. 3 months every week visiting and this crazy cat lady decided she did not like us personally. Very, very bad practice and absolutely not appropriate management of ""volunteers"". Lillian is a mean, ugly-hearted, horrible person who likes to take out her pain on people so please be VERY CAREFUL. 3/4 kittens got their owners swapped by week 10. Do not invest time going to her home, she will find a reason to screw you over. Horrible person, no solution provided by the organization. Unruly, crazy, not normal person making decision so beware she is irrational: Lillian.",,"{'time': 1592500023625, 'text': ""Crystal,\n\nI'm terribly sorry you and your daughter had this horrible experience. With more than 150 foster partners helping us save the lives of kittens during kitten season, it's very difficult to control the interactions between each foster and potential adopters. We are unable to save as many lives without them and the majority of fosters are reasonable people. Many of these kittens start their time in foster as neonates who battle sickness for weeks.. Many fosters bottle feed every few hours and give around the clock and  intensive care for weeks. That loving investment instructs our policy to allow fosters to set the basic perimeters for a adoption approval. It seems only fair to give the foster a sense of peace and confidence when sending babies off to their next life's chapter. It doesn't happen often, but occasionally a foster will deny an adoption and people are upset. Lillian has foster hundreds of kittens for us and I have no idea how many she fostered prior to us. She does have some of the strictest guidelines for the kittens in her care and we have spoken at length about this particular situation. She understands now that the manner in which she conducted this adoption process is not in alignment with our values as an organization.\n\nI know that we cannot take away the heartbreak of the last month of visits where you and your daughter bonded with the kittens you hoped to adopt. But I do hope that we can help you to find another pair of babies. Would you be open to working with us to do that? If so, are you interested in only white kittens?\n\nI do hope to hear from you and cannot apologize enough for what your family has gone through. We truly want to build families not tear them down. I have also emailed you this response. We can assign you someone who can help with the process so nothing like this happens again.""}",0x80c8c0e6adffbe01:0xaed8f27d3c1b1e0b

I went to this place yesterday 9/10/2020, and wanted to buy 10 navy pro club shirts, and 10 Khaki pro club shirts. So a total of 20 shirts. I walk in and the older Asian guy behind the counter says hello and was eating his lunch. I ask if they have pro club heavy weight shirts and what the price is. A lady came out of the back and said ""7 dollars."" I said ok 7 dollars... Then the guy behind the counter asks me in an angry loud voice ""what color do you want?""  I said Navy, and also Khaki. I ask him to tell me what the total would be for the 20 shirts including the tax. He gets even more angry and loud and says HOW MANY DO YOU WANT! I said ""ten navy, and ten khaki"" trying to keep my cool. I asked what would be the total INCLUDING TAX. He said the tax is 8.25%. (I'm trying to negotiate with this man to see if I can get a discount for buying 20 shirts) I proceed to ask him that if I buy 20 shirts from him, if I can get a discount.... He pulls the shirts away and yells NO DISCOUNT! At this point i'm upset, as there's no need for the angry attitude and yelling.  So I said ""no discount? Oh well, have a nice day,"" shrugged my arms and shoulders and walked out of there. I was willing to pay full price for the shirts but the way they treated me as a potential customer is unacceptable. I've been to this place before and the young Asian man was very inviting and professional. I think he is the son of the older Asian man that I had the displeasure of dealing with.They lost a customer for life as I will never set foot in that shack ever again.

The moment we went inside, we were not impressed by the ambience or the restaurant facilities. They don't even have luxury table or chairs. No tissue paper on the table, not even bottle of water!

We ordered Chicken Biriyani, Chicken Tikka Masala, Chicken Jalfareji, Naan. The food was pretty delish! I fell in love with this place from the first bite of food.

They have come a long way with the decor and are a family operated business. The son works throughout the restaurant, the mom runs the kitchen, and the dad helps manage & serve customers.

So the 5 star rating is for the food. If you are looking for good Indian food in Vegas that is not pretentious, this is definitely a great bet.",,,0x80c8c6113f78b86f:0x19ff3c3cd8498958

99960,113022415829291151269,Jacob Smith,1515714984829,1.0,"Horrible Service Department. We purchased a used Chrysler T&C out of state.  On a drive back from Utah, the A/C began having noticeable issues. At times it seemed like it was working, and at other times it was blowing warm air.  It was not blowing any cold air into the rear.  At this time, the A/C was still under the manufacturer's warranty.  I took the van into Jim Marsh to have it looked at, and I was told that there was a ""clogged duct"" but that they unclogged it.  It did seem to be working a little better. I asked if the freeon was low, and I was told that the level was 'within manufacturer's acceptable range"".  That was the only explanation I could get.

However, just two months later it began having the same issues. By this time, it was no longer under warranty (convenient) and they wanted to charge me to add freeon. Apparently, now that I was on the hook, it had now fallen below manufacturer's acceptable range. I should have realized this at the time and ran away from Jim Marsh.  But, alas, they are close by and convenient, so I fell for their tricks again.

Around this time my car was also having issues starting.  I took it in and it was repaired. But then it began having the same issues about 2 days later.  When speaking with the service rep, Chuck, he refused to believe that we were still having the same issues, because he had witnessed the van starting perfectly.  When we took it back in, he finally admitted that it was still having issues.  But rather than fix what I had already paid them to fix, they decided it was now an issue with the fuel pump.

Long story short, over $1200 later, my van was still having the exact same issues. And they wanted another $1000-1500 to keep trying to figure things out (next up was the fuel rail).

I took the van to a private mechanic, and he fixed the problem for under $500, by replacing the fuel pump that Jim Marsh had put in. The van then worked great, and I was able to trade it in somewhere else and get Chrysler and Jim Marsh out of my life forever.  I probably should have challenged the Jim Marsh charges with my credit card company, but instead I've decided I'll post this review and try to discourage anyone from ever going there again.",,,0x80c8eb5497b802e3:0xf0622c3e7518002e

The Steak was dry and not tender. I normally wouldn't order a Steak at a Seafood restaurant, however a family did and offered her opinion. The Bacon wrapped, stuffed Shrimp were good and the fried Shrimp were lightly battered and seasoned deliciously.
Nothing too special or out of the ordinary as far as the Buffalo Wings taste. The Brussels Sprouts were surprisingly tasteful.
The service was could have been better, there were only two waiters and the were very busy. I would say it is more of a staffing issue.

When I got up to the window I was totally embarrassed because my eyes were all red and puffy but the guy talked to me as if we had been friends for years. He was so at ease in his manner that he soon made me smile, and then he gave me a free churro and said not to worry because churros cure everything. That made me laugh so hard because I really love churros :-) So I started to eat the churro right then and there while we chatted for a minute or so until another car pulled up, at which he sincerely wished me the best and assured everything would be ok. (It was not flirting by the way, I could be his mother). Everything was suddenly ok the moment I drove away.

I wanted to like this place, but there were too many negatives and overall our group left disappointed. Food comes out as it is ready, so everyone in your party will not get their food at the same time. Everything but burgers are small plates. So if you don't want to starve, you have to order 2 or 3 small plates to have enough food for one person (about $15 each, which ends up double or triple the cost of the burger, which comes with tots).  My father got a beer, which tasted like it had gone bad (skunk). He sent it back, and the bartender (owner maybe?) tasted it and acted offended he thought that. He argued with my father instead of just saying ""I'm sorry"". (For reference, my family owns a bar and knows what a skunk beer tastes like). Bad customer service there. The mac and cheese was creamy but bland. My sister ordered a turkey burger with mango chutney. It was very spicy and no mango to be found - maybe it was cooked into the burger but it didn't seem like it. The ""spicy"" tots that came with the burgers had no seasoning on them. Maybe the kitchen was having an off day. The chicken sandwiches were ok. Overall, after spending $150 for 5 people we were not impressed.",,,0x80c8c37597507bb5:0xb52ef0e92b55e80d

1. We were told all appliances were new. Everything but the dryer, which burnt my wife's work clothes, my newborn son's clothes and an expensive blanket. We took pictures and showed the office via email and it took them 2 weeks to finally replace the dryer with a brand new one after continuously calling.

2. One of the boards under the sink fixture fell off and all it needed was to be wood glued back on and that took about 3 weeks since moving in.

3. There was a screw snagged in the carpet in the doorway to the master bathroom.

4. Numerous outlets are not secure. Anything you plug into them falls right out!

5. The cabinets arent secured tightly. I've had 2 come undone already. The first one took a while to fix and the second one I've been waiting a week to get fixed!

6. My upstairs, nextdoor and neighbor behind me are all obnoxiously different kinds of loud at the most inconvenient times. It's very inconsiderate to be stomping around after midnight, playing loud music starting at 4am, and yelling at eachother throughout the day. The walls are like paper.

7. The management doesn't communicate and acts like everything is our fault. Same with the maintenance guys. They are lazy and lack common knowledge to do their jobs.

Do not even consider applying here!",,,0x80c8ce6f09c7a49f:0xc141e9ecba6ba30b

The guy (Brandon?) who helped us was very polite. However, when I asked what options there was for Verizon assisting with buying out my current payment plan with AT and T I was told there was none despite finding opposing advertising. We were there for almost 2 hours. They attempted to switch my sim card and ensured me that the transition would work despite my phone being locked. When it didn't, the male representative offered to cancel the transfer or provide me with a free phone for 2 days until my phone was unlocked.

I asked for a lamb gyro sandwich with rice and received an answer with "" what kind? SHicken, Meet, lama?"" literally she cannot pronounce the food right. And as she was describing the options of chicken, meat or lamb, her facial expressions was with complete attitude like if I was dumb.

To Miriam:
You obviously hate your job and your attitude shows it all.  You probably have no where else to go and I dont blame you. With that attitude no one will hire you. You are worth minimum wage, NO TIP included. Even lucky they pay you with at least minimum wage.

To Owner:

I have been sitting down for at least 20 minutes and have seen all the customers that have been ordering food from Miriam come out dissapointed, frustrated, and do not look happy.  I have also been reading reviews and I do see that your gyro meat comes with lots of fat chunks. It is true, fix because 90% reviews mention it. I also saw reviews about Miriam. Ishould have read the reviews before spending $16.00 on chunks of fat gyro and a small sandwich.

Good luck on the future of this business.  Never coming back.  I would not give one star after this experience. Too bad Google requires at least one star.

Working with Matt to get our new mattress was not just simple, it was a downright pleasure. He made us feel comfortable, safe, and clean while we were in the showroom, and we ended up with exactly what we asked for! He listened to what we wanted, and what our budget was, and worked with us to help us figure out which bed would be best for our needs. At no point did he ever try to up sell us, he just showed us the options that fit our needs, and then gave us time and space to be able to try them out and discuss our options privately. We ended up finding the perfect mattress! And to top it all off, he was able to fit us into his delivery schedule earlier than we originally expected, so we got to sleep on our brand new, cozy mattress a whole night early!

The prices are for the food, location and atmosphere, but what delicious dishes we have. We chose to choose a dish or 3 per person and to share them with all of them, so that we could taste as much as possible. Everything was delicious, the best flavors I've tasted so far. Dessert basically hit it all, I had a creme brullee, which was fantastic. This is crème brullee as it is intended. A large plate full of cream with a delicious crispy crust. Well in Las Vegas everything costs money and with 4 people for 600 $ food is a lot, but the flavors were astronomical. The cocktails also tasted delicious!

The room we stayed in overlooked the track - WAY COOL!

The instructors were all very patient and very knowledgeable, took what they did very seriously and focused on keeping us and everyone safe but at the same time magically helped us learn how to drive FAST:-) and have fun doing it.

None of the staff took themselves too seriously but they created a very relaxed atmosphere while teaching us how to do what they do so well!

By the way, I’m very frugal and do not spend money loosely or foolishly but I am just returning today from our 3 day “level 1” driving school at Spring Mountain and am already booking our return.

Next time my wife and I will do two days of “one on one”  private lessons.  Again, I’m frugal but I have no idea how they let us drive their brand new Corvettes like this and make money charging us what they charge us!

By the way I’m 6’10” and they installed a custom seat so I could fit in the car with a helmet and it was glorious!

But, being “limited” to my car because of the custom installed seat, I was really bummed when I saw on my dash my TPM showing a tire problem. They immediately took me into the mechanics bay and (I’m not exaggerating) with an instructor riding shotgun threw 4 mechanics at me and 1) found the problem and 2) changed out the tire in 25 seconds!

Just like on tv!

I was back out on the track and with my group without missing any track time!

I don’t know how they do what they do for the price they charge and we will likely go back at least twice a year and maybe more, my wife and I both think this is one of our “top 5” vacations and life experiences!",,,0x80c63bb1f0ab6129:0x44fc79f1e0cb5429

Reed,1530804735551,5.0,"Had a great time here--it can be far and if you have a gas-guzzling rig, check your fill-up areas (There was a sign in Gabbs about gas, but we didn't stop and I can't verify). Tonopah and Austin may be the nearest locations if not Gabbs.  The road is easily driveable with paved and well-packed dirt. Please remember the elevation is high, so the area can receive snow in winter. Also, drive carefully. We saw antelope and cows in the area.

The shelter was easy to find (it's the giant red building!). Just follow the signs. It's a short walk or drive from the campground.

The tour was great! Our guide was Anthony, who was very knowledgeable about the fossils and the history. He's been there several years and also brings that into his presentation.

Let's talk about the dinosaurs though! There are 10 total ichthyosaur fossils, 9 still ""in situ,"" aka in the ground where they were.  I will admit just looking at the fossils and surrounding dirt, the actual identification of fossils was hard until it was pointed out by Anthony. Because of this, I highly recommend the tour. It's only $5, 40 minutes, but breaks everything down well. Check the hours for your visit, but as of July 2, 2018, the hours were:

MEMORIAL DAY TO LABOR DAY
Monday-Friday: 10am and 2pm
Saturday & Su day: 10am, 12 pm, and 2pm

THIRD SATURDAY IN MARCH TO MEMORIAL DAY
LABOR DAY TO THE SECOND SUNDAY IN NOVEMBER
Saturday & Sunday 10am and 2pm

SECOND SUNDAY IN NOVEMBER TO THIRD SUNDAY IN MARCH
by advance reservation/staff availability only

The fossil shelter is also the only place in the state park to purchase souvenirs, so time that visit! In the meantime, there is a scale image of the ichthyosaur om a concrete wall near the shelter (great photo op!), a very well-preserved Berlin mill and town or the very clean campground to spend some time at while waiting.",,,0x80bcc0e38b5bfd4d:0x71d3b1e196045154

The host said, ""I'm sorry, we have to maintain a social distance"". Immediately, we understand and take a seat. Moments later she returns and said we have a booth open but it's all the way at the end. That was awesome. We take our new seating area and the awesome waitress (Chelsea) comes within minutes and offers us help. She suggested a few appetizers and explained them. We took the Buffalo chicken dip. It needed a little balance between the chips provided and the dip but it was delicious. The dip is shredded chicken and cheese dip. She also provided help with main courses. I had my eye on the Macaroni and cheese burger, which was flavorfull but a bit dry (ask for a side of ranch and know that it's a big meal so ask for a box so you can get dessert). You have choices when it comes to fries. I got regular with ranch seasoning. Another person from our party was trying to decide between the honky tonk and the smoke shack. Chelsea suggested the smoke shack and said she won't be disappointed... and she wasn't. She could tell it was a smoked meat and the sauce had a little spicy flavor. Chelsea saw we were both at half way with our meals and asked if we wanted desert we should let her know. She told us they have a glazed Sunday doughnut (OMG... SO DELICIOUS!! but if you don't like chocolate, ask for no chocolate). They also have a bailey's cheesecake. I didn't like it, but this is not a reflection of their food. I'm not a fan of chocolate and it was drizzled with chocolate. I tried to do what I could to remove it but I just couldn't do enough. Chelsea cake as I was making a bad face because I did take a bike of my cheesecake. She asked what was wrong and I apologized for not liking it and explained that I don't like chocolate. She was genuinely apologetic and said she'd talk to her manager about it and had it removed from out bill. This place is absolutely fantastic. Our experience was phenomenal from beginning to end.

So check in on yelp to receive a free appetizer my brother checked in and his said free Mac & cheese pops and I checked in and got free bruschetta.

We also got wings for appetizers.

I loved all the appetizers we got.

I got the chicken sandwich it was good.
Sister got the sugar factory club, it was good.
Brother got the steak frites, there was some fat on there.

Milkshakes look good. But my brother said jack in the box milkshakes are better.

When it’s your birthday they turn the lights off and bring out an amazing dessert with a huge candle and they sing and put different music on.

They had house music playing pretty loud and lots of purplesh lights everywhere. Service was great. For apps we had the hot bread which was amazing, some salads, mozzarella + tomatoes, yellow tail and shrimp. All were pretty good but my fav was the yellowtail!

For main course we got the demarco (sp?) Steak, short rib, grilled salmon, porterhouse and platter of Mac and cheeses. The steaks were very solid. They got mixed up unfortunately and some were clearly better than others which were sort of dry. Overall the food was very well done and I would recommend.

The drinks as any high end place in Vegas were very well done.

In that case there are absolutely no after hour numbers to call & no one to get ahold of to let you out except for 911. Believe me, I know personally.

If you put in some effort learning the games you can audition fast. I know a student here who signed up the same day I did and had a job inside 3 weeks. Other students have done the same.
I always enjoy coming here and time always goes fast. Its easy to spend six hours here without realizing it especially if you already enjoy casino games and interacting with others.

Lots of diversity among the student pool. I spend lots of time in casinos already and when PCI is busy I find myself surprised with how closely it resembles a real casino environment. Anyone can go to school here and feel welcome. Every race and all age groups are represented here at the school and I think that alone is a pretty unique characteristic of the profession.",,"{'time': 1498157995913, 'text': 'Justin,\nThank you for the great feedback.

""Thank you for your recent order with Overnight Prints. I am sorry to inform you that there will be a delay with your order 62110787. Once the order has completed production and been assigned tracking, you will receive your Shipping Confirmation email. We apologize for the delay of your order as we understand that this unforeseen delay is inconvenient.
As the order will not be received by the date anticipated, we can credit you the difference in the shipping upon receipt of the order. All we will need is confirmation of receipt so we can have that compensation processed. We appreciate your patience and understanding with this matter.""

I immediately wrote back saying to cancel the order and did what I should have done to begin with, hire a local printer that delivered cards in one hour. This was their response:

""Thank you for your email. Unfortunately, we are unable to cancel the order for full refund once production has began, only shipping cost will be returned in this case. We can also refund you shipping difference once the order is received, or you can refuse from package for full refund.""

So they can't cancel the order but will refund shipping cost or refund partial shipping when I receive the cards or I can refuse the order and get a full refund? Why would they prefer to pay to ship the order and then refund it?

That last email came 5 days ago and 9 days after I placed my order. In the meantime, no updates, no shipping details, and no cards.

Based on the other reviews I've read here (which I should have read before ordering), if the cards ever arrive, they'll be poor quality.

Other dentists before would chastise me as the parent every time my children had checkups and needed a multitude of repair work done. Not Dr. John. He is so kind and non-judgemental and knows his stuff! Now I understand why the years of keeping after my children’s teeth wasn’t working and we have now sought out different remineralizing products to help the root of the problem.

Since then, I have been totally enamored with its history, its rise and fall. I have visited it at least a dozen times and was actually offered a portion of the locality if I agreed to teach school, in 1989, in Beatty, about five mills away.  But the year round weather and its remoteness changed my mind. But that hasn't stopped my curious nature about the town and its history, and how it was stripped of it building materials that were used to build elsewhere (like the train wooden ties  that was trucked to Death Valley Scotty's ""castle"", to be used as winter fire wood. It was never used, due to the deadly creosote content). But it is a shame that Rhyolite has been allowed to continue to crumble and decay, considering that 1980s rebirth of area mining again brought some wealth to the the Bullfrog Mining District. At least a few lovers of the town rebuilt the ""Bottle House"" before it collapsed. Rhyolite is truly a marvelous window to the region's history.",,,0x80b8a23bd54b8c57:0xbe8c088dbd7c32e8
60126,104312211481122350357,Ellen Manajarez,1603824088435,1.0,"Never go to this hospital.

They were actually horrible...They did not numb the area before putting the chest tube in me so for months afterwards, I'd have nightmares about the entire situation. I have had this exact proceedure done a few times and this was the absolute worst. The doctor that told me he had to watch a YouTube video on how to do it was better than this time at Spring Valley Hospital. I spent most of the time starving because no one knew when I could eat. I spent a lot of time in the most horrific pain imaginable. Imagine having a chest tube sewn to the inside of your body (they flipped my skin outwards, sowed the tube to the inside of my skin and flipped my skin back inwards) your person because the doctors did not put you under, give you any pain medicine, or numb the area. Oh, and when they took it out…no numbing…no medicine just scissors cutting my flesh. They tell you not to get up to go to the restroom until someone comes in a helps you...I crawled to the restroom many times on my hands and knees dragging the tube and stuff behind me because I would call every 5-10 minutes just to urinate. My friend found me in the bathroom on the floor and helped me to the bed during visitation hours because I had to urinate and I was not going to do that in the bed. When it was time to check out, I felt like I was being kicked out. They did not get me a wheel chair when I asked for one. They send me away with no medicine and a hole in the side of my body that ended up getting infected because they took the chest tube out and did not stitch the area. I was coming down from the pain medicine they gave me at the hospital and it was not a joyous occasion. My old apartment is 1 block from the hospital. I threw up 5 times on the 2 minute drive with my friend from the hospital to my apartment. I could not walk up the stairs. I was absolutely not functional and was not offered any home assistance. Like I said, I've been through this before and worse. I was sent home with medicine and information on getting a home health nurse because I live alone. Based on this experience, I'd rather die before going back to Spring Valley Hospital. I should probably post this on Yelp and Google since I spend a fair amount of time writing this and no one will read it or care either way. You'll just keep this up until someone comes along and decides they refuse to put up with it. I'm not rich so those are not things I can do...but now that I write this I may be inclined to submit a formal complaint.

In the middle of a pandemic, a representative that speaks for Spring Valley Hospital decided it was funny and to say ""oh so that's why you're mad"" and laughed at me when I told them that it is the middle of a pandemic and I do not have a job. This is not a laughing matter. People are struggling to make ends meet and somehow it's a laughing matter when people call in telling you they are doing their best trying to pay the bills. You should wipe my slate clean simply because of this. I have told you that I am struggling to make ends meet and here you decide to laugh in my face. This is not okay. It will never be okay.  It's stuff like this that tarnishes your image.

Next time, let your people know that when someone says they do not have a job because of COVID that there is nothing FUNNY about that.",,"{'time': 1603917915039, 'text': 'Hi, Ellen.

I purchased a used car, came there with two issues - tire pressure sensor was lit and both left and right mirrors were not working. They said mirrors were just disconnected and once connected they both started working. I was not charged anything for that, so thank you. But then one of the mirrors stopped working again. I dropped my car there in couple of days for additional diagnostic. Verdict – mirror is shortened from inside, you can buy mirror assembly and come to us for installation. The new part is about $1000, you can try to find a used one. I was charged $120 for this. Ok, I left. I have zero experience with fixing cars, but I tried to adjust the mirror few times and heard that it is trying to move, but cannot. Checked docs, found a part number for the actuator, purchased new original one for $100, replaced it by myself in 30 mins after watching a video on youtube. Why don’t you guys offered me replacing just the actuator, but recommended buying the whole assembly? As for the tire pressure sensor issue after thorough diagnostic by their TPMS guru I was given this response – sensors do not communicate with the computer. Two of them had no power at all, we replaced them and we know they all are working, but still do not communicate. We faced this problem second time with Lexus RX 350. Recommendation - go to a dealership for diagnostics. Ok, I left. Opened user’s manual, found the reason for this “no communication”, fixed it myself by pressing one button. Do you guys want me to teach your guru for how to fix it? I am sure this guy knows about TPMS much more than I do, but there is always space for improvement. I was not charged for that though so thank you guys for the free sensors. While diagnosing these two issues a leak in the steering rack was found, which I was not aware of. Paid $1300 for the repair and $100 for wheel alignment. Well, this is probably something you regularly do so I most likely do not have doubts about the work you have done. Overall – people are nice, space is clean, you will try to help, but used cars are full of surprises and you cannot put in too much effort, because you have to keep being profitable. Normally I do not buy used cars, but needed one for a short period and used car wants the owner’s love, not someone else’s.

15031,105950376461361414570,Sunzilla Lighting,1533941901444,5.0,"(Translated by Google) On August 6th, I went to the Grand Canyon through the Las Vegas Korean-American Travel Agency on a day course. I was waiting for you to be picked up at your hotel at 7:30 in the morning, but you did not arrive late. Your guide explained the history of Hoover Dam and Lake Mead while traveling from Vegas to Hoover Dam. After a brief stop at Hoover Dam, I took a picture and moved to Lake Mead. It was better to understand the location of the actual Grand Canyon or Valley of Fire while looking at Lake Mead, the world's largest man-made lake. I took a photo shoot and heard about what I would be doing at the Grand Canyon during my trip to Arizona. I forgot about my hunger with the water, candy, and sweets that the guide prepared, but I was hungry soon. So, for more than an hour, I ran the national road to the entrance of the Grand Canyon, stopped by Joshua Forest, and went back to the Grand Canyon after hearing the guide's explanation. (It was also nice that you were considerate enough to take pictures at each stop.) When I arrived at the Grand Canyon, the first place I stopped by bus was a small town with the theme of the Western era. After lunch here, I stopped at Eagle Point, which looks like an eagle spreading its wings, and after listening to the explanation, I took the bus again and went up to Guano Point, the last course. I can't forget the view of the Grand Canyon from the last photo shoot, standing at Guano Point. I would like to thank the Grand Canyon, who made me feel the greatness of nature, and Jun for being able to take pictures and detailed explanations wherever I go. If you have a tour plan in Las Vegas, I would recommend a Korean-American travel agency.

8월 6일 당일 코스로 라스베가스 한미 여행사를 통해 그랜드 캐년을 다녀 왔습니다. 아침 7시 30분에 호텔로 픽업 와주신다 하여 기다렸는데 늦지 않고 픽업 와주셨습니다. 베가스에서 후버 댐으로 가는 동안 후버댐과 레이크 미드의 역사를 가이드 분께서 설명 해주셨습니다. 후버댐에서 잠시 정차 후, 사진 촬영을 하고 레이크 미드로 이동 했습니다. 세계 최대 인공 호수인 레이크 미드를 한눈에 바라보며 실제 그랜드 캐년의 위치나 불의 계곡의 위치를 설명 들으니 한결 이해 하기가 좋았습니다. 사진 촬영을 하고 아리조나 주로 이동 하는 동안 그랜드 캐년에서 소화하게 될 일정을 들었습니다. 가이드분께서 준비해주신 물과 사탕, 과자등으로 배고픔은 잊었지만 곧 배가 고프긴 했습니다. 그렇게 1시간을 넘게 국도를 달려 그랜드 캐년의 초입에 들어가 조슈아 숲에 들려 가이드 분의 설명을 듣고 다시 그랜드 캐년으로 이동 했습니다. (정차 하는 곳마다 사진 촬영을 충분히 할 수 있게 배려 해주신 점 또한 좋았습니다.) 그랜드 캐년에 도착해, 버스를 타고 처음 들린 곳은 서부시대를 테마로 한 조그만한 마을이었습니다. 여기서 점심을 먹고 독수리가 날개를 피고 있는 모양을 한 이글 포인트에 들려 설명을 듣고 다시 버스를 타 마지막 코스인 구아노 포인트에 올라갔습니다. 사진 촬영을 마치고 마지막인 구아노 포인트에 서서 본 그랜드 캐년의 절경은 지금 생각해도 잊을 수가 없습니다. 자연의 위대함을 느끼게 해준 그랜드 캐년, 또 가는 곳마다 자세한 설명과 사진촬영을 충분히 할 수 있게 배려해주신 준씨에게 감사 드리며, 혹시 라스베가스에 관광 계획이 있으신 분이 있다면 한미 여행사를 추천 해드리고 싶습니다.",[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO1D--PUUxO-NUz2equ4kyXTpUW9ZQoYTovGc4e=w150-h150-k-no-p']}],,0x80c8c46ccb081fb5:0xfcc7c7d867f1fa16

I like a real massage table. I will be back again.,,,0x80c8c7b5fb899deb:0xcdd9a51a1231673f

So the pole which hangs the shower curtain in the bathroom isn't permanently put on so DURING and AFTER my shower the pole of the shower curtain kept falling. Now I am no engineer or hotel designer but I don't think that is very professional. Even MOTELS have their shower curtains in tact! Also the thing I hate about the newer hotels is that in the shower there is no border between the shower of the floor and the bathroom floor so when you are showering the water gets all over the floor of the bathroom. I don't know why these newer hotels keep doing that if they don't even provide atleast a mop to clean up all the water from the bathroom floor with. See my pictures and you'll know what I mean. Although this hotel did have a small black borderline on the floor from the shower area and the bathroom floor it wasn't enough for the water to stay on one side of the bathroom. I don't think I'll ever be coming back or recommending this hotel to anyone unless I see improvements on the room. Thank you for reading my review. ( I am currently writing

I said I wasn't sure still because I'm going when my friend goes and I'm using her friend pass and she said that if I could sign up today she could try and look for a Band-Aid for me. So I walked away and went to try and do squats. Waited for her to leave and the other person to come up so I talked to that person and said I've been bleeding for a while and asked if he could find a Band-Aid because I don't want to get blood all over the equipment. He asked me why it took so long for me to ask and I told him the situation. Less than a minute later he came from the back with two Band-Aids for me.

So first off I used their website to have someone from this company contact me to schedule and appt to come out to the house and give me a quote for how much a new sliding glass door would cost with a pet door installed inside of it.  That was the only part of this experience that was pleasant.

I get an email a few hours later from ""bulldog911"".  They do not introduce themselves, or indicate where they are emailing from, or ""thank you for contacting purrfect pet doors.""  Its just some random email that says""

There is alot of Q and A, please call 379-0609 thank you""

that's the whole email.

So I call this number, and I get an incredibly rude person named ""Eddie"" on the phone.  Based on the tone in Eddie's voice he apparently hates his job as well as the people that call in to have work done.  I explain my situation and the need for a quote. He basically tells me tells me I need to measure everything before they come out. which If I measure everything on my own they are only coming out to collect a deposit of cash or charge.  I would rather throw my dogs out the window every time they need to go outside over paying this person for a new door

Feel free to contact me direct at the hospital number.  702.263.9004.\nSincerely,\nDr. Muratore.\n\n07/18/18\nDear J.W.,  I reviewed your medical record and am a bit confused.  Your dog was first seen in May of 2016 for chronic skin problems and has received a total of 6 Cytopoint injections beginning in May of 2017 with the last one administered July 7, 2018.  I can say with almost 100 percent certainty that the medication was NOT the cause of your dog's current skin condition.  I understand that you had to wait for what seemed an excessive amount of time and for that I do apologize, however being a full service animal hospital means that there may be times when an emergency or other critical case comes in which necessitates our immediate attention and causes some of the scheduled appointments to fall behind.  Ultimately, you left the hospital with your pet after declining any and all of the medications and treatments that the doctor prescribed.  Dermatological problems are common in Southern Nevada and are especially prevalent in your particular breed of dog.  We continue to hope that your pet receives the care it requires and the skin comfort it deserves.  Las Vegas is lucky enough to have a board certified veterinary dermatology specialist who may be able to provide more relief for your companion.\nSincerely,\nTerry L. Muratore, D.V.M.""}",0x80c8cfd4055df231:0x62b30ef68b83547c

Well worth the time and effort to go see.
My brother and I were camping at Red Rocks for the repelling and hiking.  Took the time to go see Valley of Fire. No rock climbing, bolts, or chalk at Valley of Fire. Just boulder scrambling and hiking.
The Small slot canyon was cool. The petroglyphs are awesome. It’s to bad some people don’t have respect for these historical wonders and defame these Beautiful and spiritual drawings by scratching their names in the rock. Truly ignorant self centered people.

Tonight I came in and sat at their bar area not the bar. Waiter acknowledged me and never came back. He saw me sitting there alone like 3 times. As a physician and restaurant owner in NYC who is huge on customer service, this was disappointing. I spoke with young female manager who didnt seem to really care, and left to Cut. Cut steakhouse was a very pleasant experience.

Will never go back there again.

Well, my extended family had a group dinner there tonight and we went as well, hoping that our last experience was a fluke. Our server was efficient and attentive, but could have been better. However, the food was horrible. Most of the dishes looked like they had been sitting out for weeks. There was a quarter inch layer of brown, cracking dried-up sauce atop one of the soups. The refried beans had a similar layer on top of it. Everything that we were brave enough to eat was nowhere near luke warm. The beef roast from the carving station was dry and rubbery. About halfway through our first plate, both my wife and I started feeling pains in our lower abdomen which later turned into horrible noxious gas. The 1 reprieve that I was hoping for was desert. They are known for having an awesome spread, but I left the station with a little of everything and my plate left my table with almost the same amount still on it. The banana pudding literally made me and my wife bag. And I'm known for having a very strong stomach. The fudge was reminiscent of play dough with sugar added. The pecan pie tasted like a toddler made it.

My wife and I are willing to try the other location across town, but we're not optimistic.",,"{'time': 1547142222314, 'text': 'Brandon  Hi! Thank you for letting us know about this.

Staff at front desk was always friendly and tried to be helpful. They sent an email before asking for preferences - great. Upgraded also to a suite with nice view.

Problems with AC and the bill where fixed fast, altough these things should not happen anyway.

I took a puppy to get checked out because his temp was lowering, and had being trying to puke with no success. When I put my finger in his mouth to see if anything was stuck I found nothing, besides the fact my finger was now covered in blood. He was having trouble breathing as well, and at the arrivel to SVS he was taken shortly after he was taken it became ever so that apparent they were hounding me for a decision. Not to mention it was 2 in the morning, and this was a lot to take in. I was given 4 options take him home to die, pay a 900 deposit, euthanize him, or surrender him. I was very hard pressed to surrender him by all in the hospital. He was a very young pup about 4 months old, a very good looking dog. I felt pressured by staff As if one of the  had found an interest in him, and wanted me to surrender  rights beings a SVS employees have first choice to adopt the puppy.

42637,117312494974436685539,debra Parrish,1561332363803,1.0,My previous visits my nails were done by tina. Excellent service... Today. Bertha did them. I asked her twice to cut them down. When she was ready to polish them i asked her again to cut them down. She said im finished. Ready to polish. I told her no she wasnt because she needed to cut them down. She didnt want to. Her unpleasant attitude got worse after that. When the service was done i couldn't wait to leave as an unpleasant attitude from start to finish should never happen in a place of business. In the car i looked at my nails and i am highly disappointed. My nails are bumpy where they weren't filed right and some are way thicker than others. I had to refile them on the ends to smooth them so as when i touched people it wouldnt scratch them.. Because they arent smooth as they should be it makes the polish look bad. And the thickness on the ones that are too thick look like press on nails. I will have to go tomorrw to a different shop to try and get them fixed to look half way decent. Paying another shop to fix what i paid to have done. I really dont think this shop cares if thier customers are dissatisfied or not. Ive seen people go in for repairs and treated unfairly so that is why i will go somewhere else for repairs. Its ashame cause tina does a great job.

They sometimes have special guests such as professional Christian recording artists come in and cover the worship sets as well.

After one of the people I was with called the next day they were hung up on. When they called back they put the phone on speaker. The person on the other end from customer service eventually started asking if he was still there and that they couldn't hear him.  The timing of it seemed suspicious.

You'll be able to fill yourself up, but there are many other AYCE sushi restaurants of similar price with much better quality food.

The price has since gone up to $26.99 from their opening price of $20. This would be fine if the food quality was in line with their competitors, but it isn't. The fish was cut strangely on our nigiri. The super white we ordered came cooked for some reason. The oysters I ate were barely cool in temperature. It's fine not to serve the oysters on ice, but they definitely need to be cold. It's a food safety issue.

You can give them a try, but I can't recommend it. The food quality is low and there are too many better options not that far away.",,,0x80c8c514413b48db:0x58bc35f3895c6b0

The beef is so salty that all I could taste was salt, salt and more salt. I guess that's what the sauces are for but I'm not a sauce / dressing fan. I guess I'm sort of a purist because I think if the food at its core is tasty, you shouldn't have to drown it in sauce to make it edible -- and that's what is going on here. Heed the warnings about that hot sauce; it is H-O-T and that is not a myth that's overblown. That mess will light your butt on fire!

The sad pita bread was just gross. I'm a bread addict and even I didn't want to eat it. I'm not sure if it's made in-house, but I wouldn't be surprised if it's not. There was nothing fluffy nor fresh nor appetizing about it. It was bad. The tomatoes, lettuce and cheese were just your run of the mill, straight off the food delivery truck quality.

The ONLY good thing on my plate was the rice, and it is clearly the superstar. Flavorful, light and fluffy, it's worth eating (which is fortunate because it takes up the majority of the container)! This place is expensive and the portion size of the meat is too small for what it costs. I don't want to pay $10 for a lunch that consists mostly of cheap rice!

The employees are very friendly, competent and willing to help, and the crunchy falafels are a tasty vegan option (serious vegans beware: the line workers aren't as careful as they should be about cross contamination; I saw one lady scooping meat and then falafels with the same utensil).

Adding to the problem of the subpar food is the horrendous parking situation. There is quite literally NOWHERE to park. This place is located in a very busy Chinatown shopping mall so the spaces are almost always completely filled all day and all night, making this an inaccessible place to eat or to get takeout.",[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPphI9_3NcM-sFU6hyyyeO0GO6YXQo9kEADuML1=w150-h150-k-no-p']}],,0x80c8c6a765e6255f:0x2dc0c973eb44990b

Horrible place. Worst service. Rude staff. I wish i can give them a -10. The only point people choose this is because it is 24 hours and we need Indian food at night after 11. They don't have half of the food after 11, which is fine. The person who took the order lovepreet was one of the rudest staff i have seen, wish i gave a negative tip. Ordered around 12.25am and got the food at 1.15am. When asked after 45 mins, why cant you even give an idly or aloo paratha, the staff says ""WAIT. WE ARE ONLY 2 PEOPLE. IT WILL COME"".

Even better, don't go in to begin with.  Trust me.

Somethings you just can’t explain, like that little feeling in your stomach, that makes you do something completely off course. I had never been to Huntington jewelers, nor did I know it was there, nor did I ever hear anything about it. I just looked up as I was driving, crossed 3 lanes of traffic, cut someone off and turned into the parking lot, then walked in. Jennie 0, made my day, my experience and in turn made my girlfriends birthday And experience that much more extra special.

The bad: walked in and right away you can smell how fishy it was and our suspicions were confirmed when the nigiri came out. It was poorly cut unfresh fish.

The good: Our drinks were refilled quickly and the dessert orange was pretty, under-fire, but pretty. Things got out of kitchen fast but at the expense of quality.

I have a medical card from Florida and had no problem getting in in 2017.  This year recreational is legal and anyone 21 and older can purchase up to 2 ounces per day.  We got to Essence about 5:30 p.m. on a Friday.  There was a line out the door and the place was packed inside.  Because I have a medical card I was able to skip the line and go right in to the medical side of the dispensary.  It only took a minute to get a bud tender to help me.

Seth is a great guy, he helped me pick some really nice strains and they are all exactly what he said they would be.  He knows his stuff and really was kind and friendly.  My whole visit was easy and I got the vape cartridges I wanted.  In Florida we don't have legal access to whole flowers, only oils, capsules, vape pens, and some whole flowers sealed in cups you can vape.  I find the quality of the vape carts from Essence is far and above what we get in Florida.

The whole experience was great.  It might be a bit different experience if you don't have a medical card and go to the recreational side due to the long wait during 5 o'clock rush hour on a Friday.   Remember that if you have a medical card from Any State, just walk right in and bypass the line.",,"{'time': 1525125687262, 'text': ""Awesome!

When I went to get my mail the lady was completely disinterested in what I had to say. Told me to wait to speak to a supervisor. After waiting long enough and still no help. There was only 2 customers so they weren’t busy. I asked for her to just give me my mail. She wouldn’t give it to me because she said I had to prove that I worked at the business I work at. I’ve had to pick up our mail 4 other times. Do I need a Pay stub?? I’m so disgusted with the incompetence and total disregard for customer service.,,,0x80993f2be6a38105:0xd14058745bbef837

I knew I had trouble but just kept putting off going to the dentist out of fear of what would happen. The ER told me they could do nothing because it was a dental problem, so I made an appointment with Dr. Mai at Hi-tech Dental. When I showed up, everyone in the office was kind and understanding. Dr. Mai explained what needed to be done and how it would be done while I was sedated. After signing all the required papers, I was put under. The next thing I remember was asking for a sip of water because my mouth was dry. I felt no pain and the experience did not cause me any fear. I will definitely go back, and before things get to the point of needing emergency care.",,,0x80c8c7cbd234ef6f:0xe9cf67caa54d0e62

And it’s very clean.

Although it is true, ross has very good products at very good prices, but it is unfortunate that the staff (which is the image of a company) has so little discretion and tino to treat the customer ..... buy a product in Tampa , Fl, when I arrived in Vegas, I noticed that the security pin had not been removed, I went to a ross in rainbow and the staff was very friendly, they explained that they did not have the machine to demagnetize and offered me my money back, $ 9.99 or go to ross of the strip because there if they had the machine .... when talking with the manager, his answer was ..... I returned to Florida, because that way you have the receipt and the blouse the tag, I can not See in the security video if this product was purchased or not. The security pin that my blouse had, was not the pin of ross (they took it out when paying for my product) the pin that my blouse still has is the one that Ross suppliers had to remove when selling the product.
As you can expect quality of service in a company if the manager is the first to promote the lack of quality in the treatment of the client.
Really sorry. Even more regrettable is knowing that this deal will continue and just as the manager sent me back to Florida to solve a $ 9.99 problem, I will do the same with other future clients.

Pesimo servicio al cliente. Si bien es cierto, ross tiene muy buenos productos a muy buenos precios, pero es lamentable que el personal (que es la imagen de una empresa) tenga tan poco criterio y tino para tratar al cliente..... compre un producto en Tampa, Fl, al llegar a Vegas note que no me habuan removido el pinn de seguridad, fui a un ross en rainbow y el personal fue muy amable, me explicaron que no tenian ahi la maquina para desmagnetizar y me ofrecieron la devolucion de mi dinero, $9.99 o que fuera a ross del strip porque ahi si tenían la maquina.... al conversar con la manager, su respuesta fue..... regrese a Florida, porque asi tenga ud el recibo y la blusa el tag, no puedo ver en el video de seguridad si este producto fue comprado o no. El pinn de seguridad que mi blusa tenia, no era el pinn de ross (ese lo sacaron al pagar por mi producto) el pinn q mi blusa aun tiene es el que debieron remover los proveedores de Ross al venderles el producto.
Como se puede esperar calidad de servicio en una empresa si el manager es el primero en promover la falta de calidad en el trato al clirnte.
Lamentable realmente. Mas lamentable aun es saber que este trato continuara y asi como la manager me envió de regreso a Florida para solucionar un problema de $9.99 hara lo mismo con otros futuros clientes.

The storage unit was exceptionally clean and Ron even went out of his way to install a new light bulb in the unit. Moving from out of state to a new area is a big task.

As an Italian, I think the pizza was disgusting. After waiting outside for half an hour, I could not even eat my Margherita. The cheese on top was yellowish and the tomato sauce not fresh.
I never write reviews... But I felt that the advertising of this pizza was completely off. This is more like bar food, so don't expect good quality.

It was scary and difficult to go through the intervention process and find the right treatment program for her but I am so glad we chose Solutions. The staff there was extremely helpful in educating us on their programs, working with us to get her admitted, and with working with us financially. I also appreciated the education they provided for families to understand addiction. It really helped me to understand the how her addiction affected all of us and how our roles would change now that she was clean. She completed the 30 day program and then went to sober living. I believe that the continuity of the program helped her to stay committed to meetings and has helped her stay clean all these years. It seems that their program has really grown over the years and I am happy to see that they are able to help so many more people beat addiction.",,"{'time': 1457719584418, 'text': ""Christine, we are so thankful that we got to help with your sister's recovery!

We were staying at the Mandalay Bay and we saw cop cars in several different locations. We didn’t see what happened. Very pretty place but wish their was more safety but what can you do ya know? Pretty safe with metal detectors at the door but don’t know how well they work. Thankful that everything turned out ok and everyone was safe. It was hard to get out because they weren’t letting cabs in but we got one. Very shaky night.,"[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMHwvXnLCkOSHnKJBFA5q9YTdoI9KL-iHIunCZk=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMCr1rsWpsIzuxF6QTL9ptPtN7dUsU2eKB89WWp=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]","{'time': 1607028127053, 'text': 'Good afternoon Gabby Christianna,\n\nThank you for your recent feedback and 4 star view shared on Google Maps.

It bothers me because we have to wait when we buy from best buy, not the parcel, it would be they who should wait for the resolution and give us a solution at the time, we could have bought the gift in another store if they returned the money to us at the time they tell us that they lost the package.

They have  underground gated parking.  You open it with your hotel key. Very safe and comfortable  to unload and load your belongings.  They also give you free bottled water your entire stay. The worst feature is the staff is never on the same page. The deposit is $100. One time we paid in cash so we could have oht deposit back when we checked out and just this last time we stayed we were told we couldn't do that and its never been allowed and that we never did that. (You never tell a guest that they're basically lying or making things up) I always get a fridge when I check in for my medication. Again, on this last stay  I was told I couldn't have a fridge and fridges werent allowed in rooms and I would have to trust them with my meds. When we opened our room there was a fridge already there so I lucked out but why go thru all that when  obviously it's not true.

The cashiers used to be pleasant and nice to talk to, but now it's a crapshoot. When I dare to pay the high prices at Savemart, I expect a little coridalness at the register. Especially when I'm trying to be friendly even though I just paid over $4.00 (might as well be $5.00) for a gallon on milk because they were out of the $3.98 brand.

One time, I happily assisted a cashier with bagging my 15 small items totalling to about $140.00 because they were swamped. Not a glimpse of appreciation from him, much less a verbal ""thank you"". Should have expected that, as he's never friendly when I go there.  Unfortunately, I'll go back due to Savemart's convenience and just deal with it.

My daughter fell getting off a slide and hit her head and went down in the water.  Thank god for their quickly responsive team of life guards and their professional ability to move her to safety until an ambulance arrived.  She only had a concussion, but who knows if they weren't as fast and as attentive, my daughter could have drowned or been hurt seriously.

As expected food court food prices will be elevated

Food: 4/5
-at $12.99 you get a large naan, generous rice and cubes of chicken tikka masala
-the masala was a bit closer to a watery consistency than a creamy consistency
-wish there was a bit more protein for the price point
-entire meal was closer to $15 after tax and a drink. I'm thinking a buffet may have been a better choice

We decided on the tasting menu which is priced at $150 per person...outrageous but we were hoping for an outstanding dinner.  We asked the waiter who took our order if we could split the wine pairing.  He looked confused and then said he'd ask about it.  About 10 minutes later the wine steward came over and said if we shared the wine pairing, he could only pour one glass. We objected, saying most restaurants are happy to pour two glasses.  He said okay but we would each get just a tiny amount.  He was obviously trying to sell us two wine pairings.  We agreed to his terms.  Then we sat there and waited...and waited for about 15 or 20 minutes while waiters scurried past with food for other customers.   We finally got up and left.
We called another restaurant, a favorite of ours (we are locals), and they had room for us so we hopped on the tram and went to the other location,  This restaurant welcomed us.  We had a wonderful fixed price dinner not quite as expensive as Sage in a far better atmosphere with impeccable service.  They were most generous with the wine pours too.",,,0x80c8c431e35b9f01:0xa4ca7847d8dbcb31

I felt rushed and didnt have a chance to explain everything. I believe i have alopecia areata. But there was no real diagnosis done to confirm. He just  assumed it was and prescribed a cream for me to use on my scalp. I'm not really worried about the hair loss itself. It's the other things that are happening along with it. I did not get any real answers. Now i assume i have to wait for my follow up to get any real answers. So Nick if you are reading this slow down.

She was helping me to be patient and calm. Very accurate and deliver the messages through an honest but positive lens. It was a very intuitive conversation. She comprehended what was going on without poking and prodding and didn't need much of an introduction from me.  Very powerful and accurate (no sugar coating). Shocked and very very satisfied.

If Gout problems got future North Scottsdale, AZ Bank-Captain Chad Todaro out of standing post on Fridays where I found myself covering for him for over a year. Then going to the wrong bank and having to leave because of a family emergency then I might as well as leave to attend to my wife.
""April fools"".
Asking for a transfer back to Phoenix, AZ and having to wait 90 days so my benefits would expire then egg on my head. What seemed to be a good idea to move back to be with our loved ones turned out to be the cruelest joke of all. My mother-in-law was diagnosed with Cervical cancer and was expected to pull through but unfortunately a kidney infection would ravage her body as the infection was spreading rapidly through her body and she had no choice but to leave us..My wife would always prank call her mother on April Fool's Day and she would always fall for it. Now I know why Arizona Cardinal's wide-receiver Larry Fitzgerald would keep his mother's phone line on just like my wife would've loved to hear her mother answer the phone today. She would've probably said ""April Fool's pendeja, si no estoy muerta!"".
""For Reals"".
I really wish April Fool's was a real day where our loved ones were just away on ""vacation"". We never quite understand why we treat each other the way we do until it's too late and you're on the other side of the coin. Cancer exists in all of us, let's no longer be the cancer on society and really think on how we treat each other, (empathy). The bank associates were understanding of the situation and wished me good luck.

Old review: Not my first time here. Booked an appointment on a Thursday for Friday, next day...I knew it was a last minute appointment, but they had something available for the time i needed. Showed up on Friday, the receptionist at the counter checked for my appointment and said I didn't have one. Gave the name of the person I booked the appt with and he just said ""Nope, we don't have you down"". Not, ""Let me check if there's a problem"" or ""not sure what happened, but let me see if we can fit you in anyway"". I preceded to ask if there was anything available, and it didn't take him much time at all to tell me no - seems like he didn't even check. I just left because it didn't seem like there was a resolution coming from him. Later that day or a day after, I had a voice mail from that same receptionist stating that he did indeed find my appointment and apologized (didn't say what the prob was). Offered a 20% discount to come back, but already set an appointment elsewhere because of the lack of customer service. I LOVE aveda products, but i'm not going back here because of the lack of willingness to help me as a customer.  I'll get my Aveda products elsewhere.",,,0x80c8eb952126fa15:0x2215a1265561ec02

Every steak was overcooked, though and lacked the flavors we have been accustomed to when dining here. To add insult to injury, my dinner was literally dropped onto my niece. Yep, right into her lap, staining her top and pants with juices. (We had tickets for a show right after dinner & she had to attend in these clothes). The mgr visited the table but only offered to dry clean the clothes. My food arrived late due to this and I ended up with the wrong cut of meat. Dessert was good. All in all we ordered several rounds of drinks, appetizers,entrees and dessert with a bill over $1400. We left a substantial tip for the server but considering comments from our guests that the dessert was better than the steak leaves us to try another steak house when we return to Las Vegas.

The problem with this station is the ""Up"" escalator. The past several times I've been through this station it has not worked - and that's been over the course of 5 years. I can't imagine that thing is broken all the time, but it sure seems that way to the occasional visitor.

The staff hung around laughing and chatting, none came to see how the food was tasting. My fiance got the burger, it sounded amazing but came out like a deflated beach ball, think like a McDonald's $1.89 cheese burger. The bowl I ordered looked like a toddler made it, no presentation, just a mountain of lettuce with some onions on top. The burger itself was tiny , and upon finishing it my fiance wanted to leave $15 on the table and leave as I had only had one bite of my food. We brought it to our waiters attention when he came to get the plates, we told him how bad the food was. He didn't care, gave us the bill and we left. Worst $30 spent.

I've been wanting have old fashioned photos but had no luck with it from other vacations places (not even Disneyland- they don't do it anymore)for years!  And they also had two people doing cartoon drawing for person/couples/people.  They did awesome job.  The carnival/amusement park there looks amazing fun! A bit pricey..  was bummed that they don't do Rollercoaster solo price. I must buy all day pass just to ride Rollercoaster so we didn't do it.

I have been buying at Caseys for years as there is no better option in Vegas but more often than not, they don't have what I am looking for or what they do have is so outrageously priced that I refuse to buy from them. I recently purchased a new backpack from Adorama for $180 after shopping at Caseys and having the sales girl tell me that the $280 price that they had on the same exact bag is the correct price. Maybe they are buying their stuff from the sales on-line retailers that anyone can buy from, adding a huge markup, and reselling the items. If I am looking for something simple like a filter then they usually have what I need. The last time I stopped by there it was to purchase 3 of the new pocketwizards for the canon cameras and they did not have any at all. The sales guy said they only stocked them one at a time but if I wanted to special order them they could get them in a couple of weeks. I got them from B&H and even with 2 day shipping it was still slightly cheaper than what they would have been at caseys with the tax included. If I want to order something, I can do that on the internet and pay no taxes, get free shipping, and still have it faster than they can. Las Vegas really has no real camera store anymore but this one is as close at it comes. Everyone wants to open a storefront, wait until someone needs something then order it from B&H, add a 50% markup and resell it to you. Why would I want to pay them for something that I can do very easily myself. If you don't want to be a real store and stock the merchandise you are trying to sell, then close the store and go find a real job. If you do stock merchandise, then you need to price it competitively or it will only sit on the shelf and collect dust while you wonder why it won't sell.",,,0x80c8c50ff3070de9:0x274369c0561e714d

The four of us split two burgers for lunch with a side of “The Undecided,” a delectable combination of fries and onion rings, complete with ranch and chipotle mayo sauce; it was quite filling and amazing.  We will be back on our next trip “yom sayin?”",,,0x80c8c433b0b7686b:0x519f39552234c85c

The sides and appetizers are a mixed bag. The Mozzarella was creamy and flavorful. The Shrimp cocktail had very small shrimp and the cocktail sauce had no heat to it. The fingerling potatoes were dry and under-seasoned, while the white corn grits were savory, cheesy and smooth.
The creme brûlée  was very delicious as well. The “Two Smoking Barrels” cocktail was a good pair with the steak.

I originally came into the store and looked for the camera that I found online. When trying to find the camera, I was unsuccessful- I asked for help and although the staff member was nice, he was not helpful. I ended up buying another camera even after asking the employee if the camera I saw online that seemed be available for pick up here was not actually in store.
When I got home, I went to double check online to see if the camera could still be picked up and it was! So I purchased the camera I wanted and set it for pick up this morning. I went to the online pick up/exchange area- there was not clear line or staff helping. I waited at the exchange counter until I flagged someone down and asked if I needed to return my camera and pick up the one I ordered online- she said this was the line. However people who were waiting in the ""online pick up line"" were actually waiting to exhcange/return items. I let them go in front of me since they had been waiting longer and clearly were frustrated with the lack of communication. It was a busy holiday weekend and it seemed that customer service was not a priority.

When I finally got to cashier, I told her I wanted to return this camera but I wanted to  make sure my online purchase was available (I was worried that since I bought it online it might be sold out due to the holiday pricing). She didn't do much- just asked people for a device- i think to check my online purchase. after 7-8 minutes of just standing there I asked her if she needed me to do anything since I was just standing there with my ID out. she told me it would be best to stand in line for the online pick up and they would be able to handle my return..... So i went back to another line- I understand there are two different systems however I would have appreciated if the exhchange/return cashier had communicated to the person right next to her that was handling online pickups and ask them to assist me instead of standing in line again.
Once I received the camera I ordered online I said that the other cashier indicated you could help me with my return camera= I was then told to go back to the other line.

IT WAS INCREDIBLY FRUSTRATING AND A HUGE WASTE OF MY TIME. I stood in three different lines which were next to each other on the sam line of cashiers.... I don't know why I shop here. This store has gotten so bad in the last two years.",,,0x80c8c8b65f668c41:0x5920bcefe46e255a

Even now after several email requests sent, still haven't received a response from them.  At least be professional and respond with an update.   If you are the owner of Copper Knoll,  then you hired a poor property management company. I loved Your property and probably would have been a long term renter. I decided to go with another property managed by another company.  My credit is a high score with no public or collections,   I have no criminal background.  I make 6 figures plus major bonuses, I own my home for 13 years that I am selling to relocate and never missed a payment, I work remote from home and have for 10 years in the tech industry and it was only me in the agreement.  Relocating for the weather from MN.  If the communication from them was better I might of looked at another one of their properties, but since they don't respond it just shows me they will probably be poor when there is an issue with the property.  I plan on also buying investment homes and will look at other companies with better service to manage them.  My ex was a realtor and Property Manager in MN.  We had several properties we managed and I would never disrespect an owner or renter with lack of communication or follow up like this company has done.  If you are an owner I would use someone more professional.",,"{'time': 1504807377002, 'text': 'Sorry to hear that you feel this way, but because you had such a low credit score, we had to reach out to the Landlord for approval.

The one thing I really like about them is the maintenance team. They come really quickly, fix whatever needs to be fixed and is really nice from what I’ve seen so far. The office staff is nice as well, had a few miscommunications on some fees with them but they seem willing to assist and sit down and break things down to where everyone is on the same page. My main thing is maintenance though, they are better than a lot of other complex’s I’ve lived in. They just know what they are doing. Have fixed the AC, my toilet, leaks in the sink all the same day I requested it too. Place is nice overall as well. It is a bit on the pricey side and you do pay for everything water sewage etc but, they make up for it in other areas which again for me is the maintenance and upkeep of the place in general.

The service dept. used to be stellar, the same agents used to know and greet me by name. Lately, they seem to be going through employees like crazy, or maybe just hiring constantly due to the volume of business. My last several experiences have been poor, and my most recent was terrible. They overbook, are ""so busy"" and the quality of service has really declined. The people who book the ""appointments"" don't seem to be in touch with the agents, as with my last experience. After an hour's drive to arrive for my appt, I was told ""there was no way they could get me in today"", with no apology, but rather disdain from the agent and additional comments to the effect that I was the idiot for even thinking I could get in. It was a safety bag issue, I did not choose the appt. and the person who assigned me the appt over the phone assured me that it needed to be taken care of ASAP. I expressed my dismay at not being able to ""get in"" that day, and when I left told the agent I would not be back. He replied with ""OK"", never once offering an apology for wasting my day/time.

1 - Arrived at our designated time, no one was ahead of us, yet were made to wait while hosted answered a call.

2- Once escorted to our table, the gentleman didn't even bother pulling out the chair for us. If he had, he'd have seen the chunk of  MEET LAYING ON THE FLOOR  by it.  Apparently the  no one bothered to vacuum.  I brought it to their attention, and we were moved to the table right next to it.

3- Next came to complimentary roll.  Let me just say Olive garden has better bread.  This roll was extra brown, hollow, chewy & cold...totally inedible.

*At this point I told my BFF we should leave, but she really wanted to eat at Emeril's restaurant, and every birthday girl should get her wish. So we stayed....wrong!!!!

4- We proceeded to order cocktails.  They were good but not worth $18 each. (Ordered 4).

Once again, our intention was to have a nice, fancy dinner, so we knew we'd be dishing out some cash & expected great food & service to match the cost.

5- We ordered the Cracklins appetiser...it was really good. ($10)

6.  We had already looked at the menu ahead of time and knew we'd be ordering the Surf and Turf. I just needed clarification on the portion size.  Our waiter assured us it was a small 9oz steak & 5oz Lobster tail ($80).  We decided to order 2 instead of sharing, since the waiter said it was a small portion.

7. While we waited, I asked for a to go box for the Cracklins & some additional dipping sauce  to go with it, since it was a big portion & I wanted to enjoy my steak & Lobster. The waiter's assistant brought the box with a small empty container for our leftover sauce which was about a teaspoon....who does that!?! Any other restaurant brings a fresh sauce in a to go container.

8. Finally, our beautiful looking dinner arrived.  The steak was sooooo delicious.  Unfortunately, I can't say the same for the Lobster.

9. This was my 1st time ordering lobster, but I'm pretty sure it's suppose to be flakey & soft.  What I was served was a TOUGH, RUBBERY, CHEWY 🦞.  I had to use my hands to pull out the tough meet from it's shell.

10. While the assistant cleaned off our table, she asked how it was.  I was honest with my response....""the steak was delicious, but the lobster was tough, rubbery & chewy"" I answered.   The piece of lobster was still on my plate.  She rolled her eyes and left, not acknowledging me.  I saw her speaking with what seemed to be a manager.

11.  The grand finale....our waiter came over to our table, apologized for the Lobster and proudly told us the manager would be comping our appetiser.  REALLY!!!! Our bill was $250 after the comp.

I came prepared to pay & did not ask for the comp, but really I was INSULTED.

WORST BIRTHDAY DINNER...ugh.  This place was horrible.  Emeril would be appalled is he received this type of service at his own restaurant.

SAVE YOUR $$$$ for the slot machines!!!

Sincerely,

Palazzo Guest

Their dress lady is awesome and very sweet, the Rev. Nature is amazing and makes this an experience to remember. The photos leave you sad, they don't seem ""professional"" quality, and the moment is soured when at the end the photographer sits you down to see your photos, while throwing 3 envelopes at you that each suggest a $40-60 tip for each, while watching to see how much you put into each. One for the minister (which you literally just paid cash for separate from their other fees) one for the photographer and one for the dress lady. We just paid $100 for the dress and tux, so I assume the other $90 is going directly to the photographer or is split between her and the venue, since our package explicitly included her. She tried telling us she didn't get paid if we didn't pay her extra. I'm not buying it. So be prepared for a cheap deal, and a guilt trip for more money if you choose this place. For reference, here is the bill breakdown: $250 total= $50 dress rental, $50 tux rental, $60 minister donation, $90 for package #2, which included for us flowers, boutonnière, photos and a video.",,,0x80c8c386150dfe39:0x2eca3e4264201489

I have been trying to cancel for a couple weeks due to unfortunate circumstances with COVID and now its too late, so I decided to just change the dates to next year. Now they say its a 3 night minimum instead of my original 2 nights. That is a better option than losing my money so I requested it. They denied my change in dates, then when I asked about why they denied it, they said it is out of their control as my contract is with AirBnB. In speaking with AirBnB, they cannot make adjustments to reservations without the renters consent, which makes sense. To get ahold of anyone at Turnkey, I was on hold, multiple days in a row for no less than 30 minutes each time. Every time I am told the same thing, its not their problem, contact AirBnB.

Basically they want nothing to do with me and have pushed this on for so long with volleying me back and forth between AirBnB and this office that its to a point where I am going to lose my money.

Also it was windy and my change and dollar fell and she didn’t even offer to give me money back or anything.

By cousins and sister got burgers and fries too. But the last order they gave us was wrong. We ate in the parking lot cause it was cold out and I think they saw we were there. So they brought the right order out which I’m glad.

21543,102407676866604925012,Marissa Vance,1527528522318,4.0,"Honestly this is a pretty good place to work for the most part.  In case it wasn't obvious, this is a phone interviewing business.

Pros:
- Choose your own hours (They request that you work 8 hours on Saturday or Sunday, as well as 20 total hours throughout the week)
- Easy to get hired (As long as you speak fluent English)
- Relaxed environment (As long as you do your job)
- Unlimited overtime ($10 an hour, $15 an hour after 8 hours in a day or after 40 hours in a week)

Cons:
- You might get cut (If you aren't getting enough surveys, you might get sent home after 1 or 2 hours)
- Dead end job (Highly unlikely you'll move up in the company, and you will never receive an individual raise)
- Everyone hates you (Expect the people you're calling to yell, but just take it in stride and move onto the next call)
- Far away (If you're considering a $10 an hour job, you likely don't live near Rainbow and Rancho, where their current office is located)

Yeah though, in general as long as you show up and do your job, you are unlikely to get cut on a regular basis, and overall I'd say it's a pretty good job, especially for people looking for part time work.",,,0x80c8c3fdd6f5196f:0xb31f15822b1addfb

We are a family of four and lead a busy family life just like everyone else. We were starving when we showed up after my oldests school concert. The restaurant was a little busy but we were sat right away. Our server took a bit to get to us but was very friendly when she did. We placed our appetiser and drink order and off she went. My husband got a local beer on tap and then was told they didn’t have it (this seriously always happens when we come) I asked for water w lemons. Never got my lemons, asked twice then gave up! Our app took 20min then our food came right after. I ordered endless soup and salad which is suppose to come w chips never got them and never got a second helping but was still charged for endless! Our server checked on us at the beginning and then to clear plates so even if I did want more of the over salted soup I didn’t have much of an option! The chicken in my sons quesadilla was chewy he actually spit out a couple of bites. Also, I went to the restroom and immediately walked out they were a mess! My whole family was extremely disappointed, well except for the 6yr old who got to play games while he ate. Don’t think we will be visiting again any time soon.😞",,"{'time': 1525967865145, 'text': ""We're sorry to learn about your family's experience at this location, Jane.

I searched on their website they had a good deal so I drove 4 miles to their store. When I got there it Was a different price. The cashier was super nice and asked the supervisor for help. The supervisor agreed with me and took me to the butcher. The butcher was previously rude to me before I made it to the cashier, Saying that he would take an hour or so to bring the rest of the chicken he was re-feeling in the fridge. When I got there 15 minutes laterWith the supervisor, the chicken was all in the fridge. He just said an hour or so because he was having a bad day or he hates his job.
He was so rude to the supervisor she couldn’t even stand up for herself or me. In the end they never honor the prize that was on their website, it was a three dollars difference, and they for sure lost a customer for life because it’s not the first time I don’t feel valued as a customer in this Whole Foods store.

42046,112282871418071132801,Nick Litten,1560473763719,1.0,"Wow. Posting my first horrible dealership experience. I'm new to Henderson, just bought a pre-owned 2013 Audi A5 Cabriolet. First few weeks of ownership and I love the car. Discover it has an open Recall for a new air-bag. Should have been simple right? Oh No - a trail of errors followed:

Checked into Audi Henderson for the day - Airbags fitted I collected my A5, but ten minutes into homeward journey, suddenly get hard engine vibration and the dashboard lights up like a Christmas tree.  I limped off the interstate, and head back to Audi Henderson to have the mechanic report the oil plugs are badly coked up. Leave it for investigation. Next day I'm told a seal on the oil pump is faulty causing small oil spots I've seen and I need a new oil pump as well. This doesn't sound right to me, but I'm not the Audi Mechanic and since I want this car to be in tip-top condition,  I authorize both bits of work thinking it's better to have it all done. My first mistake.

Next day, collect car after paying $300 for the spark plugs (very expensive but ""hey its a dealership"") and a slick $800 for the replaced oil pump. Disgruntled, after being told there was no discount that could be applied for my troubles, I collect and drive off. Almost home, fifteen minutes later... engine warning lights and the low oil dashboard warning. Immediately call the dealer and I'm told to bring it back again. After yet more waiting around, I'm told they had forgotten to fill with oil. Very apologetic front desk personnel, but no discount apart from a free quart of oil as it was filled on the forecourt. Do they test drive cars after work? Shoddy attention to detail and inflated prices. I won't be back. 🙄

EDIT UPDATE - MAY 2019 - One month later I have a catastrophic engine failure driving to work. Heavy vibration, obviously misfiring, I limp off interstate straight into a different Service Shop who investigate engine code and tell me the Turbo has failed. Investigation shows the Turbo has a crack in it. This is most likely the cause of the oil spots!! One week and $3,500 later I have a new turbo installed but when we fire the car up, its car running (badly) and engine system warns I have no compression on cylinder one. Mechanic tells me that driving with no oil is most likely the cause of burnt cylinder internals and likely caused the failure. I go and buy a beer. Cry into it. Audi do not supply a cylinder repair option so I've been quoted $5,000 for a new engine plus $$ to fit. #aaargh

EDIT UPDATE - JUNE 2019 - Brice, the service Manager from Audi Henderson returned my call today. #huzzah The result of the call isn't exactly a resounding result but its better than nothing. Audi have offered to do an engine inspection for $free - it sounds like the mechanical version of every 50 year old mans colon exam; with cameras. Hopefully it will show the extent of the damage and give an engine rebuild $quote which I can compare against the cost of a replacement engine. Having said that - it was refreshing to have a frank discussion even if it didn't end up with the sentence ""of course we can fix that engine for $free""  ;)",[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMW98wZfjqtMWBhluF5MLZ84rHlwVKeoo9QsPOv=w150-h150-k-no-p']}],"{'time': 1554233717944, 'text': 'Nick, our apologies for your disappointing experience at Audi Henderson, we never want our clients to feel this way.

There's no place particularly enticing for when you have to be hanging around for an hour or two.  I hope there are plans in the near future to dress up the place a bit.

Nobody is in sight for us, not even a receptionist. I call their lines just in case we were in the wrong room - we weren't. After about 10min we took it upon ourselves to walk the venue alone. Ultimately, we did not want to intrude on somebody's wedding - so we left shortly after. I left a pretty nasty voicemail, letting them know to call me when THEY had time for us. About an hour later we receive a call from the person who was supposed to meet with us who apologized insincerely and said she was ""needed for the wedding taking place"". I understand that weddings take priority OF COURSE! But if that's the case, why would they schedule an appointment? And how do they keep business going without even a receptionist to take messages? Anyway, the woman who called us back tried to schedule us back a second time but apparently couldn't work us anytime after the AM - and we both work.

Juicy, ripe meaty tomato, leafy greens lettuce, crispy and non over powering pickels bring a delicious crisp contrast to the the thick cut bacon and juicy and flavorful meat patties.  The bun was very soft and sweet, close to a Kings Hawaiian roll but didn't cover up the flavor of this juicy collaboration. I give this burger a 5 all day.

Fries were your standard crincle cut with little seasoning but that cheese took it to the next level, creamy cheddar that stays creamy, you feel me? 3.5 all day

Shakes were aight as well. Had a coffee flavored shake and it tasted light on the coffee. I give it a 3 out 5.","[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM3-Ffjk0dhULiF-O8xg0ZsYrKhvcPBo8d8IFKb=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN-SWptUPh6T42RiDX4mFcDLYyDDfD1ZoGXilK0=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN7j_eXgxOtfU4p959lK58SUNVv93Bvy2nEzYHE=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOWzyQ16Ht5nWUlW095jC4QpIIr8rp10uh54Xk7=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]",,0x80c8d1dde7229e61:0xe4ac1fbf6068bd36

PLEASE CHECK BELOW ALL THE COMPLAINTS PEOPLE HAVE SHARED WITH THEIR CUSTOMER SERVICE.

I had one of the worst experiences with this restaurant! I’ll try to be concise and outline point by point. 1. Service was AWFUL! Servers were not cordial at all, seemed like they were not enjoying their job. 2. Manager was incompetent. We ordered a few plates for lunch and one of them was a chicken salad. The chicken seemed to have been left in the fridge for a long time and went right through into the plate. It was insanely cold. We explained that the person who ordered it had some issues with acid reflux and the FREEZING food would worsen it. We mentioned the waitress about this issue and she was going to help us addressing this concern. The manager came back saying that’s the way the plate is, we don’t have microwave to heat it up, so nothing to do. The waitress was very embarrassed about his response and kept excusing for this bad response. So, we are not the only ones noticing it. We came back to have breakfast (as we were guests at the hotel) expecting that we just had a bad service, but it didn’t change. Servers were just indifferent and food was just fine, except for that chicken salad.",,,0x80c8c5b42fdabdab:0xebd28683e1fd0fe0

I SPECIFICALLY set an apointment for fathers day and we counted down the days. Showed up this morning to be turned away, as they said it was not booked properly!

Heartbroken.",,"{'time': 1592938189407, 'text': ""Hi Victoria, First let me say I apologize for your recent experience at 3D Keepsake.  I'm the owner of 3D Keepsake and I got involved in this situation to ensure we address and respond to your concerns regarding your visit to 3D.  I've researched the matter and also discussed it with my staff.  Here's what I learned.\n\nI verified that you originally booked with our online scheduling system a Gender Check on Fri, Jun 19, 2020 at 9:27 AM for Sunday, June 28 at 10:45am.  A confirmation of your booking was emailed to you on Fri, Jun 19, 2020 at 9:32 AM.  At the time of your booking, I can assure you that our schedule 2 days later for Sunday, June 21 was fully booked.  In fact, it had been fully booked for over 2 weeks prior to last Friday when you made your booking.  We were essentially fully booked for the entire month of June.\n\nI was very much aware of this because we were closely tracking bookings for this past Sunday for over the prior 3 weeks, given that a new sonographer of ours was having her first day serving our clients that day.  We also notify clients of their scheduled appointment by phone and email at least 1 day ahead of their appointment.  When my staff asked you if you had received those notifications, you said you didn't receive either of them.\n\nMy staff told me that they offered you the option to stay at our office and see if we could work you into that day's schedule, and also offered to expand our schedule to accommodate you the following Tuesday (6/23) - today.  Our staff does everything possible to accommodate our clients when there's a misunderstanding of appointment times.  I'm truly sorry if you believe our staff made no effort to correct what you thought was a mistake and if you felt they were condescending to you.\n\nDespite the misunderstanding of the appointment date, I'd like to do whatever possible to keep you as a client.  If you'd like me to contact you in that regard, I will reach out to you.  Again, I apologize for the misunderstanding and hope you'll allow me the opportunity to retain you as a client.\n\nSteve""}",0x809914f065ac9e1b:0x6f35884e3eea0b6c

1. They ARE NOT AT THE AIRPORT, you have to take 2 bus to reach them.
2. Their driver (of the second shuttle) did not close the back door properly on the small bus. Our 2 years old son was sitting in it's stroller right next to it. I close the door while he was still driving (he never stopped despite most of the passenger yelled at him).
3. Booking 3 customers with 3 agent took only 45 minutes (HOW IS THIS POSSIBLE)
4. The car was Grand Cheerokee ''similar'' and we got a Huyndai Tuscon. Forgot about our dirt road plans in the desert. Ground clearance, tires and low range gear box were NOT EQUIVALENT. No other cars in the parking lot so had to take it
5. Returned the car with ease. (only process that was ok with them)
6. 2 months later, receive a phone call from an unknown number (nothing gets out from google search). The lady told me we have an outstanding cleaning fee to pay. The car was sandy when we returned it but nothing abnormal (after 2 weeks in the desert with the family). She said she will look a the situation and it might be ok.
7. Receive another call from another lady (VERY ARROGANT) from their collection department. Claiming us 80USD. I explained my previous discussions but she kept yelling at me. I told her nothing will happen until I receive hard copies of their claim. She said they don't do that. She finally hang-up abruptly the phone call.

SO just pay a couple of extra $$ to get a car from a renter that offer service I had been very happy with Hertz, Avis, budget, Entreprise or europcar in the past. But FOX I just don't understand how they can still be in business.",,,0x80c8cf24950d0537:0xb6ff04f5243df61f

After initial diagnosis of potential breakage, the knowledgeable nurse ordered a mobile x-ray and another contracted company came out with a mobile x-ray machine and shot some pictures of my foot which they sent to Quest.

The nurses diagnosis was accurate and along with instructions to stay off of my foot as much as possible, I was issued a cast sand and they even contacted my primary care for follow-up. Once again, this is an outstanding company!",,,0x80c8c15fb269d245:0x8ef08a4f763f4be3

I still hadn't made up my mind and was feeling very stressed over the whole idea of moving across the country.

She and the manager, John, walked me through the entire process. Even though it was  rent day and busy, both were patient and professional. I  was approved and on my way home the next day. Best of all the rent was reasonable for the location and the views are serene. Everything was completed and processed online, including signing the lease and  making any applicable payments. Two months later Jennifer was the consultant on duty when my husband and I moved in. She continued the courtesy and professionalism exhibited by her co-workers. The apartment had new carpet and, aside from a few minor issues which were taken care of immediately, I was very satisfed with the condition. So far I am very glad we moved here. So many qualities made this seem like a nice place to relocate. However, the staff has made all the difference in it being a great place to live.",,,0x80c8d5a7eb2e5293:0xed2e63e49f56c828

I have PTSD and high level of anxiety, I ended up crying in a exam room with the vet bashing me about how I was a horrible owner to let it get this bad and I didn't take care of my dog.

After that fact I brought my dog home and had to take my baby to the er and when I came home early in the morning I found that my dog scratched most of her fur off her muzzle and was bleeding. I called around to try and find anyone that would take walk-ins as my dog's regular vet does not. I found this place but after my last experience at a different animal hospital I was very anxious about coming here.
I came in and was helped immediately with great customer service,  they helped me throughout the process and the wait time wasn't that long for a walk in only 30-45 minutes which is great to me.
The vet's tech (I think that is what you call her) Beckie, was great with my dog as she didn't drag my dog as the other animal hospital did she listened when I told her to give my dog her command and she would go. I only had to wait maybe two minutes and the vet came in to see my dog.

Dr. Luikart was very nice to me and explained what my dog had and how quickly it can spread along the body if you don't know what you are looking out for. I informed her that my dog's regular vet said at first it was an allergy of her food possibly and after switching foods it did clear up but then started to come back then my vet said it was probably because she was covered with fleas when she came from California and that she has hot spots.  The other animal hospital determined it was a specific type of mites that was causing it but only gave pills to help with the skin not anything to help her internally. Dr. Luikart informed me she was also going to give my dog a pill to help internally and a shampoo to help her skin too.
This animal hospital was very nice and compassionate to me. Thank you very much.",,,0x8099392fafa182a1:0x1218c4d53075ff55

Kinda a little long for a fast airport service location. There was also a fair bit of drama from the 4 servers working making remarks about other patrons and arguing with each other.

We where just a few blocks away from home and just left the pet hospital with two dogs so we relied on Uber. The ride lasted around 10 minutes at best from Flamingo to Tropicana area behind UNLV. One of the dogs just got treatment for an ailment so we had to get home so he could get some rest. Unfortunately in getting out of the car and handling the dogs, she dropped her phone on the floor in the back seat area. She discovered that once we got inside she was missing her phone. So without her phone we had trouble contacting the driver Mellisa via last paid trip. I got lucky and called her phone that was lost and Mellisa answered. Uber normally charges 15 dollars for a driver to go out of route so when she told me she found the phone in the back seat area she was heading back to bring the phone. We waited and waited. Mellisa never showed up, so I contacted Uber through my app and she did as well. Here it is 30 some hours later  we get a message that the phone was dropped off way across town at a Green light Hub on Fort Apache. Shame on you Mellisa and you too Uber ..... I had to get yelled at all night and most of the day today .... inconsiderate and not bringing the phone back and she has wheels. That Uber driver Mellisa won't have any good luck for this. That's why her rating surely will not be five stars after this review. Thanks Uber when I get my license reinstated soon I will drive for you and Lyft and save your company from going out of existence.

It took a long time for doctors to get things figured out, but nobody at Las Vegas Cremations ever called with updates. Many times I was told somebody would call me back but they never did. I was the one who had to initiate the call every time.

The reason they're still getting four stars from me is very simple. When somebody dies it is one of the most vulnerable times in your life. I've had other funerary, Mortuary and cremation companies take advantage of that by trying to upsell you on unnecessary items, jewelry, urns, and coffins. Las Vegas cremations did none of that. We explained to them what our budget was and what we were attempting to do and they helped us reach that at a very reasonable cost.

They seem compassionate and didn't just treat us like ""just another customer."" All of that said I would recommend them.",,,0x80c8c114086d6dab:0xbab944a244fd0a53

However they recently made BIG changes to the happy hour menu making it seem completely different. Cheeseburger sliders which we would all get every week have been completely removed from the happy hour menu. So i ordered the bbq chicken flatbread which i have had many times still tastes the same but is cut differently and looks as though it is far less food. Crunchy spicy tuna rolls which is another thing i get every time are made differently now and look like there is less effort put in them along with being less crunchy. I did not check if they removed lagunitas ipa from happy hour but the price went from 4$ to $6.50 for the same sized beer. Have loved this place and have come almost every sunday for happy hour and other days not during happy hour but with such  major changes im afraid i will not be returning nearly as often.,,"{'time': 1576266257514, 'text': 'Thank you for your feedback.

The rooms have a FULL kitchen which is great as we are able to prepare our own meals and save a lot of money by not eating out daily. There are also BBQ setups around the pool area which made for nice gatherings. Each room also has a washer and dryer so you don't have to leave your room to do laundry.

We moved in a rental, made arrangements with Aiden, did everything he asked, then he broke his word and had us evicted. We cleaned as much as we could. This place was a wreck when we got here. We had to stop because he promised a dumpster, several times, it never showed. He told us to not fix our swamp cooler, he would have 'Mike' come by. Mike is apparently a ghost, as we never did see him. All is well... this place will look exactly like we found it when we got here (old motor in swamp cooler and all). Three children to worry about, but he doesn't care. This place is a joke, and more people that he's done wrong need to come forward. If you're looking for a place in Silver Springs, I'd not go through this place. James Dwiggins is about to find out about Aiden and his 'tactics'. Word is bond, and his is worthless!

If you think I'm just an angry nobody who didn't pay their rent, that is not the case. Ask around town. Every restaurant in town has a special sauce for Aiden, and he didn't even know. Yeah, what a guy...

And now, well over a year later, Aiden is no longer the property manager (but is still employed, somehow), and now they're trying to say the trash here is ours. I guess they think we're small potatoes here in Silver Springs, as they've stated ""it's a waste of their time even being here"". Now, they said the house was sold, we'd be getting a 30 day no cause and would be good until the 31st of August.  (have this on video)... house didn't sell, now they sent a 5 day pay or quit, via email (haha). Rod and Barbara are not to be trusted, and I'm not to be toyed with. Now we go to big boy court, with many witnesses of what the property looked like, and issues w/ Realty World themselves.. hop aboard the tort express!! Rod, I knew this was coming, it's why I recorded you in the first place. See you in court... as this seems like retaliation for us telling them the trash was not ours. I could go on about the swamp cooler, the way the shed was left or even the way they were supposed to, and failed, to secure the previous tenants property. The front porch, where a lot was isn't going to cut it. I'm excited for this!",,,0x8098f09b69845321:0x30ed9da74418dd25

Each time we go to the Nugget for breakfast  lunch or dinner. Not much of a gambler and never stayed there so cannot comment objectively on that  side of the house. The food and service each visit is superb. Portions and price are remarkable and if you leave hungry its your own fault. Only fault I can see is: I'm temporarily in a wheelchair and while regular parking is adequately and plentifully, handicaped parking is woefully inadequate. It seems that the Nugget isn't aware of the age and preponderance of their client demographics. There may be planning or other limitations I'm not aware of but I don't take that into consideration when I have to get dropped off at the side entrance and be told not so gently that we can't park there and to 'move along'. So I suggest adding more HC parking or at least conduct some customer service training with the security people when someone is struggling to get out of a car and onto a walket, to get into the building and spend money....",,"{'time': 1548275327930, 'text': 'We are delighted you chose Pahrump Nugget for your recent visit.

And for full transparency, I have no preconceived bias since I do not know the owner or the people that wrote the negative reviews. But if you look at the facts, they don’t lie. All Federal, State, and Local laws were followed. The owner did not have a crystal ball and could not predict the future. Blaming the owner is like blaming a car INSTEAD of the person who got in that car and drove drunk and killed someone. Was it a tragedy? Of course, no one can deny that. But the fact of the matter is that the 2nd amendment gives rights to bear arms so long you can pass a background check with no criminal record. If the owner refused to sell someone a firearm based upon the way they looked then that would be blatant discrimination which by the way discrimination laws is also protected by our Constitution. What if someone would pass a background check but the owner didn’t like the color of their skin so didn’t sell to them, do you see how ridiculous that sounds? You can’t pick and choose when it comes to someone’s Constitutional rights. If one of you wanted to buy a firearm, had no criminal background, and passed every background check but the owner refused to sell to you, then you would cry discrimination. Do you see how hypocritical that sounds. The 2nd amendment is just as protected as the 1st amendment or any amendment for that matter. All of you that are writing negative reviews, if there was no 1st amendment, then you could possibly go to jail over the reviews you wrote since you would have no freedom of speech or laws protecting such, you wouldn’t like that I bet? So you can’t pick and choose which amendments are right and which are wrong. For the record, I’m a neither a Democrat or Republican. I’m a logical thinker that sticks with the facts and law. It’s not right to try to defame someone or their livelihood if they are a law abiding person. If you don’t like guns, then write to your local Congressman or Senator to remove the 2nd amendment from our Constitution. But if you pick and choose which ones to follow, then that threatens the very framework and fabric of our Democracy.  You have every right to vote for Politicians that you feel would represent our Country and Constitution the best (right to vote which is also protected by State laws). If you think about it logically it’s really unjustifiable hate that kills more than anything. If you take it out on the vessel but not the actor then why aren’t we banning cars, knives, or even bleach? All these items can kill someone. I stand with the owner, and his business should not be disrupted over this. I’m sure he is very much as hurt as we all are, if not even more so. Unite don’t divide, and love don’t hate.",,"{'time': 1564854657453, 'text': 'Thank you'}",0x809886c7f0130c45:0x5596c61c4347219c

I did not have a good feeling about the salesman Jacob or the Sales Manager that moved here from Florida (don't remember his name) so I took pictures of the bike on the sales floor that we agreed to buy. After paying, we left and in the car I compared the paperwork with the picture and the model #'s did not match. We immediately turned around and went back to the store. BOTH the manager and Jacob assured us it was the same bike even when I pointed out the one on the sales floor says ""CLF"" but the one they sold us said ""BLF"". On Christmas Eve, we go to pick it up and sure enough, it was the wrong bike. Fortunately the Parts Manager and his crew were there and truly saved the day! They stayed well past closing ON CHRISTMAS
EVE and figured out the ""B"" has the smaller tires and the ""C"" (correct bike) has the larger tires. When we purchased, we SPECIFICALLY told Jacob and the Manager we wanted the larger tires. I'm certain they will have an ""excuse"".",,"{'time': 1577475763146, 'text': 'Hey Elizabeth, thank you for taking the time to review your past visit.

Was easy to get to, good location.
Everyone working there was all smiles and confident.(had a friendly dog there too!)
Everyone was encouraging and answered any questions we had.
I had originally scheduled my jump weeks in advance. First time jumper. Im a big guy and was worried about my weight, 230-250, but they said no issues. They match you with a size appropriate instructor and get you going. I was also worried about clothing and weather-temp at height. But it's so fast you don't need to worry about being cold.
I wore 5.11 pants, hiking boots and a long sleeve tee with over shirt. (Was a little warm in it)

They took us up quickly, got us to height and once the door opened they dont give you alot of time to think about what's going on. Door opened, final safety check, high fives and fist bumps. Then out we went. Was AMAZING. Nothing like I thought. You land just out from takeoff so anyone with you can watch. Was great.
My wife wanted to jump but was on the fence. Once I got back after the jump, she decided to do it and they rushed to get her on the next plane.
She was TERRIFIED. But when she landed she said it was terrifying AND amazing. For someone with a fear of heights they made the great experience.
Our tandem instructors were amazing.
Mine was Rafa(pronounced Hoffa). He made me feel comfortable right away. Good instruction, easy to follow. It didn't seem like a ""job"" to be my tandem instructor.
My wife's tandem was McCaan. He kept her encouraged, calm, safe and couldn't wait for her to experience the jump.
These guys are great. I can't wait to jump again.
Thanks GoJump
WAS GREAT.",,"{'time': 1556213391936, 'text': ""James! What a killer review! Thank you so much for taking time to share your experience! We had a blast jumping with you guys. Can't wait to get you back in the air.""}",0x80cf4982ba403a77:0xaafe83130c088e4a

If things don't go well you spend your time trying to redeem the image that has gone out about you and your company. I can truly say that my husband and I were extremely satisfied with the entire presentations of both speakers. This coaching program is full of pertinent information on how you can change your life for the better. I have attended many coaching seminars and workshops. However what Daymond John has created is the most detailed and the most informative program I have ever been introduced to. My husband and I learned a lot from the speakers on that night and are looking forward to completing the entire course soon. We thank you Daymond John for helping business owners like us for a fraction of the cost that it would take to get our businesses where they need to be.

I went in to the ER 13 days ago because of Cellulitis. The staff there were really helpful and prescribed me Cephalexin and told me to follow up with Dr Hugh Burt in two weeks time. Cephalexin helped but did not make the Cellulitis go away. The office was very busy that day and I ended up waiting for 3 hours total for a 45 minute appointment, in which 30 of those minutes I spent naked on the table waiting for the doctor to come back in after he stepped out to let me change, it took me a total of 3 min to get changed.  Meanwhile he was seeing several other patients. Either way, he came back into the office, pushed around on the infected area for a while while as I cringed, and than said he will prescribe me Clindamycin, even though I have taken this antibiotic before and it has not helped. I have been battling this infection for over 2 months now and it is no longer a mild infection and I believe he should have prescribed me on something to finely cure it, not to milk it another two weeks so i would need to come in to the office again and pay for another appointment and then perhaps prescribe something like Vancomycin, Daptomycin or Linezolid to cure it. I dont understand why it is that this doctors insists I finish a medication that is not helping my infection and is making it worse. Either way I don't believe that this doctor went about the appointment in a professional manner, and it seemed as if they were just trying to schedule as many appointments as possible, even if it means people would have to make multiple visits.  what do you think?",,,0x80c8c51dcfe166d5:0x911b916db190d82f

If you're interested in a cool, 1hr drive outside of Las Vegas, head down Blue Diamond to Pahrump for an interesting history lesson on the old west.

Pahrump Musuem is small, yet nimble. You'll find some authentic pieces that date back 100-150 years and each tell a story.

Your tour guide will most likely be the Museum Director (Mariyln Davis) who will welcome you (and your pets) with open arms.

Make sure to tour the outside grounds which features an ACTUAL general store from 1905 which was preserved and moved there for display.","[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMnDVQ74UvXM7t4yQzQiPHh_BLYkR-v2sJzsxFT=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNPXQNNOtW7SRQ5OV-PJKxsblVProX__p0DrSj8=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNtrpVUvYJqOwX5RJGkshaXuC4MZ1_vXxcL-6Zf=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOJFxXA9DxAo_eHE9MvUv4R56V_WOaI-IwApugX=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPYA5AEVDPLHey3pZcZLFo-yOxkXoKVRQ7D1Yuz=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]",,0x80c637bce05bd5a3:0x17672b7cbaeba0f5

We sat outside on the deck and it was gorgeous day, a good 35-40 degrees cooler than Las Vegas it's self.
My hubby had a burger, which was cooked  to his liking but did not have much flavor, note he is used to me spice'n up the hamburger at home before I throw it on the grill so, he'll get over it. The fries were perfect....I tried them myself.
He has never snow skied so I'm hoping I'll get him up there to learn when the season permits.

I was there about a year ago and got the Huevos Rancheros which was the most amazing thing I had ever had. For a year I anxiously awaited the day I'd be able to return. Alas, I returned a week ago to finally have the superb chorizo, eggs and ranchero sauce grace my tongue again once more. Shortly after receiving my meal I found myself in a deep state of despair and disappointment. Not only had they changed the way in which the dish was prepared, they had eliminated the ranchero sauce and replaced it with a salsa verde and decided to still name it ""Huevos Rancheros"". IT IS NOT HUEVOS RANCHEROS WITHOUT RANCHERO SAUCE! It is simply a chorizo scramble with salsa verde and pathetic oversized pinto beans and a tortilla.

When I asked the waitress if I was crazy or if the dish had been changed, she confirmed it was different and informed me that several customers had complained about the new entree and the owner refuses to change it back.

Will change to 5 stars if the #REALHUEVOSRANVHEROS returns. For now, Midtown Eats is extremely overpriced for mid-grade at best food.",,,0x809940b82ce118dd:0xc3fc613659beb1a8

Went to try to buy something last week because oriellys didn't have it.  An hour and a half and i couldn't find a single worker in the store so i finally walked out without anything.

The guys who helped us (I won't blast their names) kept going back and forth with the manager throwing the ""free"" tablet in our face.  Also throwing in some ""discounts"" which after I checked my receipt, was only $1 here $2 there. (I thought it would be a signficant amount). Just a heads up for people who don't upgrade as often, that you end up paying a monthly plan for the $100 tablet.  It's only free if you get a plan for it. (They never told us this) They also promised us a gift card that we never got.

Now that's all fine and dandy for people who want a tablet plan but they did not mention any of that to us.  We would've not gotten it cause it does not fit our budget.  They said our bill would only go up x amount.  It ended up going up $60.  All in all, the free and discounted bells and whistles all come with a price.  I don't want this happening to other people so that's why I'm writing this review and making Sprint customers to be aware.

89827,117728993796397371956,Becky Crooker,1581134148904,1.0,"I was a patient at Nevada Eye Physicians for several years, and was very happy. I had an eye infection a few years back that Dr. Lee treated diligently (and successfully). I went elsewhere for two years while they worked out issues with their insurance, but was happy this year to be able to once again make an appointment with a doctor's office that I enjoyed.

However, in the two year interim, things have drastically changed.  I made an appointment and on the phone explained that I had changed vision insurance.  When I showed up for my appointment, I checked in and waited to be asked for my identification and insurance information.  That never happened.  Either they are very trusting or not properly running their office.

Eventually, I was called back for my appointment.  The tech began performing tests and I explained that I wanted to update both my glasses and contacts prescription.  That was when he told me that they no longer did contact lens fittings at that location.  I have never heard of an eye doctor's office that does not provide contacts prescriptions.  I was quite unhappy, especially since no one had bothered to mention this when I booked an appointment.   In light of having taken time off of work only to need a second appointment elsewhere, I decided to make the most of the visit and get my glasses prescription updated.  Dr. Lee came in and quickly looked at me (although I waited a while as he was not even in the office at the time of my appointment), and then left.  When I checked out, the office staff attempted to get me to book an appointment at their Henderson location to get my contacts updated.  I declined.

I went elsewhere and spent a significant amount of money buying a few pairs of glasses with my updated prescription.  While I could see, I felt like my night vision was different than it had been with my last pair of glasses.  However, I couldn't imagine how that could be possible and tried to ignore the differences.  Flash forward to today where I finally had an appointment elsewhere to take care of the contacts issue (Dr. Alissa Nagel and her staff at VisionWorks were pleasant, professional, and conducted the most thorough eye exam I have ever had).  While there, they had me put on my glasses  as a starting point for checking my prescription.  Dr. Nagel quickly stated that my prescription seemed off and asked if I was having trouble seeing at night.  Apparently, the prescription I was given does not properly account for my astigmatism, causing light to look different at night.

So, in sum, Nevada Eye Physicians was once lovely, but my latest (and last) experience left me with 1) wasted time; 2) no contacts prescription; and 3) an incorrect glasses prescription, plus the bonus of knowing anyone can make an appointment and be treated without showing identification. Save your time and money and go elsewhere.",,,0x80c8b891d7f29e69:0xb2286b66e9be8bb1

All we needed was a SIM card.  It took 30 minutes for us to get waited on.  We wanted to replace the iPhone 4 my wife had with an iPhone 5 our son had given her.  The rep did not know what he was doing and wasn't really interested in helping us since we weren't making a purchase. After several minutes of conversation, I decided it would be best to backup the iPhone 4 at home since he said he couldnt help us do that.  We paid a $20 service fee and went home. After serveral attempts online and an hour on the phone, the rep on the phone determined the store had sold us the wrong SIM card. He had one overnighted to us and it took 10 minutes to get it installed.
I went back to the Pahrump store to return the SIM card for a refund.  The store refused to refund the money.  The clerk and the manager claimed it was a service fee and they could not refund service fees.  I pointed out that I had not received the correct ""service"". They final word was they would not refund my money and I should leave their store.
I will not return to this store.  If you feel you must see and handle the product, go there for a demonstration and then order it by phone or online.

I am feeling so thankful that my community has Dr. Song as a dentist and feeling blessed that he & his office staff helped me to trust  the process. From 1973 I have had teeth issues from an accident that left years of issues. All of my front teeth were  about ready to fall out of my head - literally. My adult children knew that i feared the possibility of dentures, fear of becoming that person who lives without teeth because they don’t fit right, too big, hurt to much...whatever negative could be - I thought or felt it. So scared of the not knowing and then trusting a dentist who wouldn’t help or understand, not only with the teeth but with the emotions that would come with whatever work needed to be done. As I talked with my family they were beginning to see my teeth wiggle with every breath or word I spoke. One afternoon my son called and said mom I found this dentist on Yelp who I think you should go see. If you have to get dentures and you don’t like them there are other options he offers like something called snap on dentures. Needless to say I went and it was literally life changing. From the first moment i walked in I felt at ease. His staff is absolutely amazing (especially Andrea) and very welcoming.
Doctor Song came in after the X-rays and said I would need dentures. He told me what the process would be...explained that it would take some getting use to, but he would help me and he would explain everything as we went through the process.  Without the risk of writing a book, I want you to know that Doctor Song is AMAZING. Everything he does within his practice is so professional but he also truly understands that there is a person who has fears and emotions connected to these teeth. He makes the whole process so simple.
I want you to know that he was so gentle that even after 3 sets of impressions, I didnt lose any of my front teeth! I recommend anyone and everyone to Dr Song, he is truly phenomenal an artist in his profession and I am so appreciative to have him as my dentist. And my new teeth make me feel better then I have ever felt. Tears Doctor Song!! Thank you for the happy tears!",,,0x809914fcc590cefd:0x96fc2f1f2fe9289e

I eat at Roberto’s almost every day and go to different locations all the time. This one may be the worst.

1.  It is run down and really dirty. The bathroom says it’s “out of service”, but it not. You have to ask the cashier for a key.

2.  My carne asada burrito meat tasted not so good and was smaller than normal. The red sauce was not what it should be like and did not taste good at all.

3.  They always say it’s $1.25 for debt, so you have to say credit. It’s the same!!!  A lady was going to walk out because of this, so I told her to tell them to run it as credit. She almost walked out and then was really mad that they tried to do that.  Almost lost a customer, until I said something. Your welcome!

The driver was pre tipped online and after I signed the receipt she looks for another tip then got a straight face and stood by front door for a minute instead of leaving like they suppose to. Me and my family are ready to go to another company for pizza.

Dominos, on longley ln

This dominos use to be great but has gone down hill quick. I don't know if they got a new manager, all new employees or what the deal is, I refuse to continue to eat here the consist fully uncooked food is a waste of hard earn money and asking to be food poison.",,"{'time': 1610462695979, 'text': 'Hello Justin unkown,\nI see that you made this review a little while ago and we would love the opportunity to earn a 5-star review from you!

I would also like to mention their inventory has been getting better they are working with people on prices and try to make sure the cars they sell are in decent shape and will run properly they also have an in house mechanic and actually help with quite a bit...
Definitely worth checking them out they will also try to get a vehicle if your looking for something more specific they will try to find it for you...

But I mean it truly they are good people again I've said it and will say again when your buying used cars you need to do your due diligence and inspect or have the car inspected but they do their best to be good people and good to their customers ty again Quality Motors it truly means a lot !!!!

OK here’s the bad news. We do an annual golf trip every year and rent from the enterprise location at McCarran international airport in Las Vegas and return the vehicle to the same place. We rent a vehicle for one week. We received the wrong vehicle to start. Every year we rent a suburban which fits our needs. So the Ford that we received was not only damaged but smelled horrible and had the left quarter panel Almost hanging off. We noted this with video and pictures while standing in front of the agent. This really put a damper in my confidence that Enterprise is really looking after customer service. The guys were not happy about driving in this car and not only did he have damage but it smelled inside. When I asked the agent for the suburban that we reserved he said this is a better choice and your suburban would take two or three hours to get cleaned up. We were on a tight schedule so we were forced to take this vehicle. All in all This was not a good experience,,"{'time': 1595939444435, 'text': 'Mr. Ward, we would like to look into this further.

We were seated in the middle of the floor on these individual throne-like chairs where the table did not extend past the toes. Such that, you would have to uncomfortably lean forward from the edge of your sofa chair to eat your food.

To start, the wait staff was kind, and our appetizer (a foie gras dish) was delicious. I was a fool to believe the rest of my meal was going to be as pleasant.

I ordered the rib eye medium rare. The knife provided was closer to a butter knife than a steak knife. Unsharp and barely serrated, I worked on my ungodly gristly steak with it as I balanced on the edge of my unreclining La-Z-Boy. The steak was overcooked but you could not tell by the sight of it because the room was flooded by this horrendous red light. Every steak looked every condition of rarity in this dining room.

I held my tongue about my food because I did not want to worsen the already unsalvagable atmosphere for my dining mates. I tipped the meal as I could not have blamed the wait staff, but it was difficult paying on top of the $25 for still water.

This was supposed to be the meal of our trip to indulge. If you are looking for the same thing, I recommend that you go elsewhere.",,,0x80c8c430cb5147bd:0xa286b6508b85ce87

Food was dried out except fried chicken and that had no flavor. The food offered did not look just prepared, it looked like it had been sitting out for hours. The fruit and salad was fresh. The Mexican food offered was very unappealing and none of us were willing to try it. The waiters all looked exhausted and ready to go home. No smiles from any of the wait staff or food service people. Over all very disappointing and I think I'm done trying their buffets at different times in hopes it will be better than the last. It happens to be right across the street from Palms which just st got a really good rating from Best of Las Vegas. It's $5.00 more than this buffet ,but I'm willing to pay extra for a much better experience.

53745,100137026990285133670,David Brooks,1543758678438,2.0,"We were convinced by Austin to buy through them due to having better service support than their competitors if warranty work needed to be done down the road. We ordered a large iconic 5th wheel toy hauler with all the specs we liked and put almost $5 thousand down on the unit. After 6 and a half months of waiting and multiple calls both to this dealership and their manufacture (eclipse rv) i find out that eclipse rv discontinued the model we ordered and the new model is going to be a couple thousand more, granted the new model does have a few more features but i feel they should have fulfilled our order first especially after $5k down. After calling countless times with no information on new model pricing and everyone taking the ""head in sand approach"".. talking to all 3 eclipse rv sales managers and getting vague answers on easy questions like ""what are the new model interior color schemes?""
Each of the 3 eclipse rv sales managers tell me different pricing but all say no more than $3 thousand increase in price. Finally i get a call from Austin with western skies and he says they should start building it in about 2 weeks and it's going to be $6 grand more for a total price of about $59723.58(out the door). I told him that's way more than what eclpise told me and my absolute max that I'll pay is $3k more and he tells me the BS response that he's actually losing money on the deal..first of all.. who comes up with an even number of $6 thousand more? You'd think it would be like $2637.65 or something especially since western skies told me that he talked to eclipse rv and they were just going to charge me the cost difference between the two models..secondly, he's telling me that he's losing money on this deal when we are $3 grand away on a 60k trailer?? Lies.... needless to say Austin was ""willing"" to give me my deposit back and i told him expect an appropriate review..

Now to be fair when i put a deposit down he did warn me that there is a possibility of some color changes and ""rarely make slight changes to units in order to facilitate a smoother switch before the next model year"" his words.

I hope this review is helpful to anyone looking to buy an rv",,"{'time': 1557516735081, 'text': 'This is the owner of Western Skies RV, Bill Burko.  I understand why you were disappointed that you did not receive the unit that you wanted.   The model was discontinued and the closest new model in the next model year had numerous changes and an increase in price.  You agree that it was a much nicer model with and extra slide room etc.   Austin is my son and his desk is directly next to mine so I heard the numerous phone conversations he had with you about this unit.   You make numerous assumptions about what you think happened and then call Austin a liar when what you assumed proved to be wrong. You fail to point out that we had the unit you wanted in stock ready to go but you were getting prices from multiple dealers from other states and wanted us to match their price.  We always do the best to be competitive on price but we were in the high season and only had one unit left for the whole spring and knew it would be quite a while to get another one.  Austin is a true Toyhauler, Eclipse expert and he pointed out to you numerous times how the information the other dealers were giving you was incorrect.   You asked us to match an offer from an out of state dealer and we checked and the other dealer didn\'t have the product but would order you one.  He also guaranteed the unit would be in in by July which we told you would not happen.  You said you were willing to wait to save the money so we ordered you a unit.  We told you in no uncertain terms that we could not guarantee a delivery time because of the popularity of Eclipse products.   We also told you that if the price went up to us we would have to pass that price on to you.   So you are right the price did not go up exactly, $6000 dollars.   It went up over six thousand by several hundred dollars but we rounded, DOWN, to try to keep you happy.   You say that three different Eclipse manufactures reps gave you ""vague"" answers but were very clear that the price would not go up over $3,000.   If you would like to come in to the dealership I will be happy to show you the price sheets on both units and prove to you where you are in error.   Unfortunately, I don\'t think this ever mattered to you and you stated that we either give you the price you demanded or you would write us a negative review which you have done for both us and Eclipse.  Again, I understand you are disappointed that you did not get the unit you wanted but to accuse Austin of lying when changes were made that we had no control over is unfair especially when he was the only person warning you of what could happen with an order.  Austin never lied to you about any of the things you have accused him of and you owe him an apology.'}",0x809915392fe855af:0xe3dbbdaf1449f17b

88385,110032112774026366990,Kristin Bleich,1533843810338,3.0,"I am extremely frustrated with Ford at this point. My car would not start on Wednesday night,  I got it jumped and drove home,  knowing that I would either need a jump or a tow in the morning.  Thursday morning,  I called the Ford roadside for a jump,  giving myself plenty of time to drop it off at Ford and get to work.  After originally having an ETA of 8:24, then me calling the service provider,  and them saying 20 minutes,  then calling AGAIN at 9:15, when they should have been there 50+ minutes before that,  and they told me ANOTHER 30 minutes,  I had to cancel.  I was already late to work and decided to just have it towed in to Ford.  I had the request for a tow started at 9:15, and an ETA of 90 minutes.  Not a big deal,  I was at work anyways.  I went on my first break around 11:15 and they still hadn't gotten my car.  It took them another 90 minutes to even get it in to Ford.  Understandably,  when Ford got my car,  I figured they would have it through Friday, at the latest.  I have gotten very little updates regarding my car,  aside from the fact that it needed a new battery.  I'm reasonable and I understand that things take time,  but this is incredibly frustrating and extremely unacceptable.  It's already midway through Saturday and I haven't had any updates about my car in over 24 hours,  despite reaching out to the service writer. I am extremely disappointed as I've never had any issues with the service department,  or Ford itself.

EDIT: I called Ford regarding my car around 4pm to be told that my car was done, but yet I still hadn't received ANY call regarding it.  The lady over the phone told me that they closed at 5 and I would need to come down before then, otherwise I would have to wait until Monday.  After processing the paperwork (and finding out it was only the battery that was changed), I asked a service writer how long it should take to change the battery (half a day is what she told me.)  I told her I didn't understand why it had been 2+ days that they had had my car.  She took me to the manager, Rachel.  Rachel, while super nice, tried to be helpful.  They explained to me that the gentleman that usually does the batteries had to leave early yesterday (not my fault?).  The manager and the other service writer then explained (after i told them my frustrations with the gentleman that I had been dealing with), that he was new and had only been there a week.  Rachel then explained that her hands were tied and they could either give me a free tank of gas, or free detailing on my next visit (because I'm such a loyal customer!).  Feeling a little bit defeated, I just took the free detailing.  I find myself to be pretty reasonable and patient, but to have to wait as long as I did for a simple battery change and oil change, I'm still extremely frustrated.

Edit (8/9): Ford reached out to me regarding my frustrations,  and while it was resolved,  mostly.  I still think it was handled incorrectly to begin with.",,"{'time': 1532388785335, 'text': 'I am sorry to hear about your experience with us.

It took 45 minutes to bring out more food and it was only the crab legs. It was over an hour before they refilled any of the actual entrees. When they finally brought more entrees, it was only 3 and the pepper beef was so overcooked, it tasted like a poorly made beef jerky. Not pleasant. Now the waitress... She rushed getting our drinks when we first sat down and did not get our drinks right. That was the only time she ever came to the table. The only time we saw her after that, was half an hour later when she was in the buffet getting herself food to eat. We literally had nobody to help us.

I'm a very easily over stressed out snd worrisome person and Jamie helped me relax and feel much better about what was happening to me. She helped me calm down and stop stressing out. The doctor and staff really made me feel like they cared about me and my well being. I actually felt much better before I even left the clinic. I definately reccomend anyone needing to go to a clinic or urgent care to go to this location!

Service: Party of five and it was tough to find a seat because they were busy.  A host informed us that if we wanted a table that it would require a two drink minimum per person which we were fine with. One of my friends doesn't drink so I had to step it up.  A server would stop by about every 15 minutes to check up on us.  It's a small lounge so it was easy to wave her down if we need anything.  The DJ was firing classic dance music from the 90s to present day.  There are no tables in front of him so it's an unofficial/official dance floor.  People were getting their groove on throughout the night.  The music is loud so you're going to have to speak up considerably to get your game/convo on.

Ambiance: The bar is so long it almost extends the whole back wall.  They carry all top shelf booze and they were staffed with plenty of bartenders to keep the drinks flowing.    Regular Vegas Strip bar pricing at $15+ per cocktail.  Dim lighting and dark wood make for a very attractive and classy vibe in this lounge.  The staff are all dressed sharply in dark formal wear.   If the DJ isn't there giving the party vibe, it appears it can be a quiet place to grab cocktails on a date or catch up with friends. Whether I'm here for loud or quiet drinks, this is a very attractive lounge that I'll visit again when I'm at Park MGM.  Cheers!",,,0x80c8c5ae4a24934b:0x29acdf26d6696ed4

Putting up tents together, cooking in a group and sharing unforgettable experience made the time in the group special. The scenery of the National Parks is breathtaking and the well organised structure of the tour gives as much time to explore the parks as possible without getting to stressful. Justin did everything in his power to make it an unforgettable trip and as he always said ""we'll make it work"" - he did!! I can highly recommend this tour.

85247,105333124461925759079,Han Stevenson,1558035130714,5.0,"There is a new game out there called ""Chubby Cattle"" where you stuff large amounts of meat into your mouth and say nothing... just chew, swallow, and let the serotonin do its job to your body.

Setting: I have been here during its grand opening and have returned for its re-grand opening. The decor of the restaurant has been updated with an improved layout to the sauce station. Previously the sauce station was on what looked like a plastic wedding cake design now in a more buffet style, but is a bit cramp as many diners will be all over experimenting with sauces and other additions. The party area does boast individual hot pot stoves for large parties and a large stove in the middle for the larger broth option.

Service: Pretty typical but it was a busy Saturday night, we seem to have three different servers tending to our tables. Drinks were a tad slow but nothing to lose yourself over.

Food: The oxtail broth, new cuts of meat, add new items on the conveyor belt (chicken feet, enoki mushrooms wrapped in bacon). Being a big oxtail fan, I chose the oxtail broth which was... a bit bland. The sauce station helped play a nice role as I experimented with my broth by adding spicy, salty, bitter, sweet etc... till it matched exactly what I wanted. Wagyu was beautifully marbled with a nice chewy but not so melt in your mouth texture.

Personal Choice: Tomato broth and the spicy broth are great! Brisket + Wagyu Beef + side of enoki + rice. Bam!

Overall: One of my favorite places to eat hot pot. Great quality meat and savory flavorful broth, this place has it all!",,"{'time': 1558202252749, 'text': ""Hi Han,\n\nThank you for your feedback!

They are stocked but very very bad service!!! In this time everyone needs food we understand and they put limits on certain things. We followed the limits and yet when you go to pay they say another different thing about the limit. That is not right how are they going to have signs that say limit on this item and at the register they do not honor that.

We had one shopping cart for me and my mom the carts were very limited so we took one for both of us. Another lady came to the register said we should not have that much food. We clearly said to them it is two of us using one cart and we each have our own home and families, and each payed our own separate food ! They asked for proof to show IDs to show that we had different addresses. To me this was not right not good service accusing your customers. I did not want to show my ID they did not have the right to ask for that type of information from us I did not have to explain myself of where I lived to them. They stated a cop told them to do that. I did not see no cop there at all, and there was no type of signs stating you have to show your ID to the cashier. If a cop was there asking all customers for an ID proof that they did not live together that is different but from an employee sorry but NO!!!!

34664,109753626070422273268,Brooke Noble,1498265272467,2.0,"This is my first time renting from a large corporation, and I am overall, not satisfied. I feel like, my concerns are never addressed. They never work with me on anything. From the very start, they couldn't meet me at the place I was renting, I had to go to the other side of town, get the keys, leave a deposit - go check out the place, and all within their business hours. This was just a huge pain (at the time I worked during their business hours, so I had to take time off work to accommodate them). Then they charged me more than what was listed for the pet deposit... whatever... I paid it. Then they sent out an email asking if they could remove some garbage cans from our property, I replied to the email saying I would like to keep my garbage can, and a week later, only my garbage can was gone. It takes way too long to get things fixed, I reported issues and the landlord came over, brought the things to fix the issues, and then just stored them in my house - they have been sitting there for a year now. When I renewed my lease, I asked them if those things could be fixed, especially since rent was increasing, they said yes - but then nothing ever came of it. I asked for a parcel box so I could receive packages so the homeless people who live behind our unit don't steal them - they told me to get a PO box because they are unwilling to provide a box for packages.

Bottom line, there is zero customer service. You pay them, you can live there. But don't expect your property to be maintained, or things to be fixed. You will have to constantly hound them if you want something done. You will always have to leave a message and response times can vary between a couple days or a couple weeks. I feel like as a customer it’s their job to provide service - and they simply don't. They will nickel and dime you at every junction. It's all about the money - not community relationships or unit management. I've been living in my unit for about a year and a half now and if it wasn't so hard to find somewhere else in Reno I would have left by now because I just hate the interaction I have with them. I feel like a money cow to them and nothing else. Bare minimum.

They could improve this. They could follow up on service request. They could answer calls. They could respect your wishes when they ask to do something and you say no. They could meet you half way on improvements. They could check in and see if people are satisfied after work has been “completed”. And a big one, they could give us a freaking parcel box.

Other things that would help – would be doing a little extra when working with residents or potential residents. Things like, meeting folks at the potential property – you know, answer questions, address concerns and issues together. They could be timelier in request for repairs. I’d be happy if I felt like they just cared.

Prior to committing to being married at Paradise Wedding Chapel, I literally researched and scoured through every possible chapel, venue, and option all leaving me unimpressed and hopeless with finding a tacky wedding option that wasn’t going to require a second mortgage. Low and behold I came across exactly what I was looking for with Paradise Wedding Chapel. From the very first email correspondence with Julie ( who has been amazing from day one and responded quicker that I could or would have imagined) and the beautiful pictures shown on their website, I knew this is where my fiancé and I would be married! Tony was our officiant and Julie was our photographer both of whom did an incredible job. Both were so warm, friendly, and welcoming to us and the entire ceremony was comfortable and joyous! The chapel itself is a must see to believe! The Paradise Wedding Chapel is everything we wanted in a chapel. It’s clean, classy yet simple, and elegant. There’s nothing tacky or cheesy about this venue only a purely, intimate, and romantic vibe and scene! If I had to do it all over again I without a doubt and without hesitation would get married all over again at Paradise Wedding Chapel!

I visited this place as I personally cannot pass up a occasional Baconator. I know, unhealthy.

But I digress

The customer service here was absolutely appalling.

If I am being honest it looks like the lead of the front end was overwhelmed causing the whole team to lose composure.

A guest had also had trouble with his order.

It seems their frosty machine was down and the manager refused to confront the guest personally and leave the issue to what it seems was a very inexperieced cashier.

Store was dead on a Sunday night, and dirty as ever.

Shout out to the cooks though cause that Baconator was satisfying.

When I arrived at the location with my family which is a party of 6 (3 children 3 adults) they informed me that we cannot sit together since they have a restriction of 5 per table. Mind you this was not said when I called originally. Then one of the servers informed me to best accommodate us the kids can sit in the table right next one another. Since that was said we agreed and decided to still join the waitlist. Once we were called they told us “I’m sorry you guys can’t sit next to the table next to theirs” I requested the manager and he did not show any sympathy just shrugged it off, apologized and said those are the CSD rules.

The decor is really nice and tasteful.  The Chinese New Year decorations were nice too.
Why 3 stars??   Some areas smelled of strong cigarette smoke and yes I know it's Las Vegas.  But some hotels have good methods for making places smell good, especially if you are entering the hotel suites, yet I smelled old spilled beer instead by the elevators and no refreshing smell when arriving to the suite.  Also, I was quite disappointed with the restaurants that we ate at in the Grand Canal Shopping area.  I was expecting exceptional tastes, but got lots of bland food at very high prices.

The drink specials were great and the food was wonderful.  This led to us going back that evening for a late dinner.  Unfortunately the service was so bad it almost ruined our evening.  I don't recall the servers name but he had a distinct look with a mustache curled at each side. He approached the table with a very poor attitude.  ""What do you guys want "". No hello I am xxxx  what would you ladies like. When we asked about dinner specials his response was no we don't have that. One of the ladies asked about crab cakes or rolls which were plainly identified on the menu which he stated they didn't serve.  At this point we all felt as though he did not want to wait on us. When one of the ladies asked another server who the manager was. The manager politely came over to our table.  We didn't want to complain prior to our food being served for fear of what he might do to it. He noticed the manager at our table and his attitude promptly changed.  I typically am not the person to immediately jump to conclusions but I genuinely feel he did not want to serve our table because we were women of color.  I hope that Ocean One Bar will take this review seriously and address the waiter. Again we were at your restaurant Saturday night around 9 PM and we sat at the booth directly near the hostess stand.

A wonderful experience of life driving vehicles of that caliber and I could achieve all this with this great car rental company LA Exotic Rentals.

I came back to visit and decided to stop in and check the store out.( I now have a favorite knife store !! )when you first walk in,it's a little overwhelming because there are knives everywhere but that's exactly what I was looking for in a cutlery shop . they have a lot of quality knives and I was excited to look and handle some knives that I have seen online that I would never have the opportunity to see and feel the quality unless I just purchased it first online.I met the owner Lynn bonds and I really enjoyed talking to her ,she is full of knowledge and very helpful as well as her employees. they had no problems with me asking to see many of the knives they had in their cases, unlike some stores I have gone into . They do not get annoyed by having to open the case a few times to play with the knives . The prices are a bit high ,but I am sure Lynn would work with you on the price, Remember it is a small store and they have to make a living! it's well worth a few extra bucks to keep such a great local store in business. another great service the store offers is that they sharpen knives at great prices with next day service. so to make a long story short...I would highly recommend this store if your looking for some unique and quality knives that you can't find anywhere else with some nice people to deal with and maybe learn a thing or two while your there! next time I'm in town I will definitely stop in .I hope this review helps!!!! :-)",,,0x80c8c3fdf09ccf97:0xe003997a361acf7b

They have fantastic service and their drinks from the bar are exquisitely made.  I am never disappointed when eating here or ordering something for takeout.

When they first opened, the luxury was phenomenal with comfortable seats, great food options, a nice bar, and in-theater waiting service. All of this made it worth the extra money to see a movie there...although in the beginning, the movie options weren’t the greatest.

Today, the movie options have improved, but we have lost a lot of what made this theater better than the rest. The prices of tickets and food/beverages have increased, while the quality of food, amount of food options, and number of staff has gone way down.

You have to wait in line forever to order your food or drinks and food prep takes forever because of the lack of staff. Each day I have gone I have been told they no longer offer in-theater waiting service on that particular day (no matter what day of the week it is).

Sometimes there is a ticket taker, sometimes the bartender does it, sometimes we are on our own to scan our tickets with a device. Why am I purchasing expensive tickets for my family while it would be so easy to just walk in to any theater and hope I grab an open seat?

Your level of service and appeal are dwindling, making you just another theater like the rest. Please, please bring back what made you guys stand out: great food options (not regular movie food), in-theater waiting service, and more staff in the lobby.

Three stars because the theater is beautiful and always clean. I’ll bump up to 5 when they bring back the lost luxury.",,,0x80c8be55606b16a5:0x8c033cd28572ef93

My server was pretty good, the food is definitely not cheap, but typical for this type of restaurant.
My meal with my daughter (one combo plate, a kids meal, iced tea, juice, and a terrible dessert) was about $55.
Anyway, I saw ""fried ice cream"" on the menu and usually this is a mexican favorite so I paid the $8.50 for my daughter to have it, expecting something of decent quality. TERRIBLE! Their version is simply vanilla ice cream with soggy cereal (fruity pebbles) sprinkled on top and a ton of weird, old tasting whipped cream.
My daughter took one or two bites and wouldn't touch it again. I tried to take a few bites, but it was so bad. I mentioned to the hostess that something seemed wrong and she just shrugged it off saying that's just how it is, so she didn't seem concerned. I still think something was wrong, but we'll never know.
Totally ruined what would have been a decent visit. Now, we are left with that as our lasting impression so we won't be rushing back any time soon.

I can always tell whether thai is authentic by the mushrooms - dead giveaway. HOWEVER - I will not judge the entire meal based on this & I've still had delicious thai despite this.

First off - the egg rolls were SO mushy & soggy inside & had a really strange after taste, so unfortunately - I didn't enjoy these at all. The soup was WAY too sour, to the point where you can't even taste anything BUT the lemongrass. I hate when they do this because it throws the entire ingredients off & just RUINS the soup! The chow mein wasn't bad but definitely lacked flavor.

But the most annoying thing wasn't even the food, it was the lady at the counter. I asked her if there was any way she could offer a discount or make something ELSE for me since I didn't even EAT my soup or egg rolls, to which she replied, ""No."" No apology WHAT-SO-EVER, just a flat, emotionless ""NO."" I was beyond irritated at that point because they didn't care whatsoever about making their customers happy as long as they get their MONEY!

I also found it funny cause there were people there saying this was the ""best thai in town""... & I thought how the heck would you know unless you've tried every single thai place in town? LOL I only came here cause I wasn't in my area & this was just convenient for me. But so far my favorite place (on Fremont st) is by far the most authentic & FLAVORFUL thai I've found YET.

I called asking her about the 50% off party packages they were advertising; for her to say she will see into that and hung up on me. I called back and she acted as if it wasn’t her who I had spoken with. She responded by saying there are a lot of employees, it could have been anyone. (Mind you, I called as soon as it opened at 10am, so there aren’t even that many customers to which they need that many employees, but that’s besides the point)
She finally answered my initial question that they don’t have that offer anywhere. Which I told her I actually screenshot it. She said her manager was right next to her and said the same thing. She asked me exactly where that deal was, which I told her several times it was on their Facebook page.
She then starts telling me in a rude manner other options I have, either Groupon or their actual packages in store. I replied with why they have that promotion and to call now for that deal if they won’t honor it. If this incident happened with just a phone call, imagine if I actually book them for my son’s party. Very unprofessional and a lying company. I will make sure to tell all the people I know to never step foot there or book any party. Thank you Get Air for proving to me you are not worth our time and money. Your loss! At least LOL Kids Club is around the corner and my son’s bday party their last year was a blast! I highly recommend that place.

Update 04/29/18: Chad has gone above and beyond in accommodating my son's bday birthday that is coming up soon. I may have had a bad experience with the corporate office but Chad the owner has far surpassed all of that and found an awesome solution. I can't wait for my son's 6th birthday party now!!!

Update 05/31/2018: My Son’s birthday party was this past Sunday, May 27th, and I am truly in love with this facility. We’ve been to several different trampoline parks and by far this was has been the most accommodating and amazing experience we’ve had. I truly appreciate Chad, Seth, and Damon for going above and beyond in making my son’s birthday party the best of all years!!!
A total of 21 kids attended my son’s party with 3 hours of fun.
Even the parents loved it and want their kids’ birthday party there as well.
We CANNOT thank you guys enough for your patience, selflessness, and most of all your support. The pizza provided by Get Air was delicious, and I also hope Seth and the staff liked the Mexican dish I made as well.
We will see each other very soon.","[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNgbCxqNQ-WOG80v6WG90gfGh8vJ9znun5TYpct=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOPntTrJ5FBJkkhXnhozZjK8s2WejzQNzNek2lV=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]","{'time': 1524162358412, 'text': 'Hi Sarah.

I have no idea what happened there but I would like to extend that offer to you. I cannot however allow our call call center located in Utah to treat a customer such as you were treated.

If you are willing to give my park and our local staff a second chance, I promise we will treat you with the respect you deserve.

He came to my room which he didn't have a key to and was able to turn the handle and walk right in.

Thanks to the exotic car rental in Las Vegas, I was able to fulfill a dream that I always had, to drive an exotic car; to be more exact, a Lamborghini.

On top of all this, they have the best prices and customer service! And being honest, it took me a lot to go to their company and receive the car, so they explained to me that they could deliver it to my house; thanks to this I was able to enjoy it without any problem.

Since I contacted them through their website, the site gave me enormous confidence as they explain all their questions in detail. When I finally decided on the car I wanted to rent, I called them and they made me feel the best, as I said, they have the best customer service. Thanks to all this I was able to make a dream come true, perhaps, if this company did not exist I would never have driven a lambo; this experience finally inspires me to work very hard hoping to be the owner of an exotic car.
They also have all the best exotic cars of the moment!

We had our vendor/client meeting here and we were seated right away! The server was extremely helpful when it came to being sensitive to our dietary needs. We had a person who was gluten-free and myself (vegan).

We decided to go the sharable bites route and ordered a whole bunch of menu items such as the crispy cauliflower (vegan), Catch Roll, Mango Shrimp Roll, Vegetable King Roll (vegan) with ponzu sauce, Cod Lettuce Wraps, Lobster Rolls, Roasted Spaghetti (vegan), Crispy Brussel Sprouts (vegan), Parmesan-Truffle Fries (vegan) and for dessert, we had their signature ""Hit Me"" cake and the vegan pistachio cheesecake (so good!).

From the list, I definitely recommend the vegan crispy cauliflower! One of the best items on the menu! The Roasted Spaghetti was a bit too salty for me and the Brussel Sprouts a bit too oily. The vegan pistachio cheesecake was so delicious, it was paired with vanilla sorbet.","[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNPkrdflaUTQRfPG6z30bMjGQwDEqjXNsROvjSe=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOlIDzTJMeeMLA7xzzZhOG1SGr7OcmYg01IMU38=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNmLP1SnbIhdd901djXSIZ5dZs7fiWIpto7YEwb=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM6aIEXzYMQNw1OLXAhSSkrvjh3RuWPX5SVaOvF=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPPksYO6FWBbAgmuH_HGdQy1UIlbE3GCPUGSKx0=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNRVpGqzwvevOZK2fE-4bZJ8TXxVDaodqQwhjHO=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOQtg5xSBTjPr37tud0GqxG8KSAEOPUNdyMjnfl=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN03B3151vzQvaTZ2t47oX7gfp58EA6rEFH2z87=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]",,0x80c8c5c19d130acd:0x3c21d17be20c58ce

57878,116968238790810881412,Food Guru,1605082155536,2.0,"Dr Cutter struggles with making level and good bonded fills and she does not take criticism well instead she will ask you to find a new dentist.

Dr Cutter believes her fillings should only last several months when really composite fillings should last years.

I had 11 fillings done with Dr Cutter. Out of the 11 fills nearly 5 of those fillings fell out. 2 out of the 5 composite fills that fell out were replaced on two and three separate occasions. 6 or 7 of the 11 fills protruded beyond the tooth structure leaving me in a awkward position asking her to polish and bring them down to my actual tooth level. She seemed agitated  and annoyed when I asked her to do better work. Further wondering why she didn’t just do a good job the first time.

She replaced a poor filling she did on my first molar that fell out since she messed up so bad she then explained to me that I will need a crown if her fill doesn’t last. So that tooth that only needed a filling will need a crown if her sketchy filling doesn’t hold. Yay I love loosing a molar due to poor dental work.

Dr Cutter left many of my fillings that she performed uneven and protruding beyond my tooth structure. She continued to deny her poor work and continue to express to me that I was the problem and her failing and uneven fillings she had performed were somehow my fault. She did attempt to correct her work after I had to remind her over and over again the importance of creating flush and even fillings. After expressing frustration with her work due to so many appts needing to be made in attempts to correct her work she then told me the fillings she performed several months earlier were not her problem. She likes to leave copious amounts of composite filling overhangs in random places throughout her fillings because she doesn’t believe some patients are worth that 5-star work. She also told me not to come back because I asked her if she felt confident enough in her work to have it checked by another dentist. Since I was loosing faith in her work.

Beware she doesn’t take her time and she will deny her poor work and will continuously shift blame on the patient. It’s petty and poor behavior of any doctor instead of just listening to your patients you have to rebuttal and guard your frail ego. Your patient is upset with your poor work and your ego superseded the patients needs.

I’m not even sure if the composite fillings she did perform were done correctly. I will have to see another dentist to find out the severity of damage that may have been left by her.

I just don’t understand why we have to deal with bad dental work within the 21st century. I also don’t understand why a dentist would want to even cause their patients to suffer with poor work. Why do we have to correct our dentists? Why can’t we get safe and effective work here?

I asked her how can you perform a root canal and crown build up when you can’t even do a proper 3 surface composite fill appropriately?

Be careful guys she’s just one out of many dentists who don’t care about her patients. Instead she will give you work she thinks you deserve and in my case she believed I wasn’t worth 5-star work.",,,0x80c8c6d41aaa38dd:0x73b45c40a52f2623

Weird vibe, almost fake and very kitschy Japanese culture. Saw the waiter wash out our beer glasses in the handwashing sink, which was the first indication that we should have left. We stayed and were continually disappointed with each plate.
Service was slow and lacking energy. Our waiter claimed the PDAs were just reset so he was taking our orders very slowly and I had to repeat myself a couple times. Of the 10ish beers on tap, only one was available, and the waiter brought an entire pitcher instead of the glass that we ordered (which I normally wouldn't complain about, but it was disgusting).
The food was edible but not good or delicious. I would pay $15 for a meal like this but we paid $26. I have had sushi from the kiosk at Sprouts that was better.
The best thing was the mochi ice cream, and I feel sad even writing that.",,"{'time': 1611300429144, 'text': 'We appreciate your review and comments, and we are very sorry that you didn’t enjoy your dinner with us. we have a commercial dishwasher for all our bar wares and glasses, there is a dump sink next to it, I think that’s what you was we dumping the left over drinks and rinse the glass before going into the washer.\nYou are correct, we are a little slow and backed up when we get a little overwhelmed, unfortunately due to the suffering from the covid, we need to take extra steps to keep everyone safe including our customers and staffs , we are trying our best to keep the doors opened and saving the jobs for our staffs.\nWe are working nonstop to improve our service and food quality for our customers, we welcome and greatly appreciate comments and suggestions like yours , we hope to see you again, to show you our effects.'}",0x80c8c57316d0cce5:0x238ed9ce87391c38

Yet, the bumpers surrounding the karts are sensitive enough that even a moderate bump slows the karts. Also, if it's difficult to pass another racer, a flag will be shown which tells racers ""Caution: let the racer behind you pass you - they are faster"". I'm also signed up for the email racing results, and it helps me review my own progressive. If the wait is too long, their location makes it easy to kill an hour or two, either by their VR system, various arcade and crane games, or the Fallas and Target literally right next to them.

Located in the Forum Shops (so no, sadly we can't earn Caesars Rewards' points), it's one of the most beautiful restaurants I've ever visited - gorgeous copper, lush fabrics, a seafaring theme, complete with live tanks.

I sat at the bar and had a great experience. The bartender (a woman) was absolutely fabulous - great conversationalist, energetic and eager to please, and a FABULOUS mixologist. I had a holiday-themed drink - the Poinsettia - and it was divine. If I didn't have an appointment at a nearby spa, I would have had another round!

Food wise, I had a lobster roll. The roll was delicious, big chunks of lob, and the fries were divine. Thick cut and just plain tasty. It was hard to decide on an entree - the menu is overwhelming, but if you love seafood, you'll walk out out of Water Grill spending a boat load (no pun intended) on the fresh seafood offerings.

My opinion it was not worth the $19.50 after tax price.,[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNPO_bJiIssNhFXNCZYSj35VLMnL4ZuIFALERbw=w150-h150-k-no-p']}],"{'time': 1623514250176, 'text': 'Suzy-\n\nFirst, we’d like to start off by thanking you for stopping by our truck, as you have many options and you chose ours.\n\nFor the gumbo, our pricing is different than that of a taco truck, in that it takes hours to create what we make for our guests. The whole crawfish (claws, tails, bodies) in the gumbo is hard to find fresh out here, so when we do find some, our price point and portion size has to reflect that as well, which is also why we offer different sizes for all our dishes.\n\nAs for the tail meat in the crawfish, that is literally the part most people enjoy, which is breaking into them and then sucking the heads, claws and bodies.

We went in to ask about having a brand new AT&T card activated for my boyfriends cell phone and possibly buy a new TV stand.  Since the sim card was already in his phone the first girl that helped us said that the sim card itself had to be purchased at their store or they could not activate it. Next we asked if someone else could possibly help because we have had the this done before at other locations. We waited almost 30 minutes  which was no big deal as we were shopping for a new TV stand as well.  The girl who helped us initially made it seem like her co worker or manager  could activate the sim card for us as it took so damn long for him to even come out to the sales floor to help us. All he did was tell us the same exact thing. Huge waste of time. Can't wait till e-commerce puts Best Buy out of business.,,,0x80993ff59c8dc2ad:0x7f9ea929d13b703a

I was patient the first two times considering covid but after the 3rd and 4th time I was upset and ask if I could get compensated for having to wait half a year for my sectional.

For such a small motel I was impressed with the magnitude of this place.  There's an old Western Town called ""Old Town Nevada"", a train, a petting zoo, a restaurant, horse back riding a pool and etc..  With the exception of an idiot cowboy who liked to fire his gun within close proximity to ear drums the staff seemed great.  I do not recommend the Saloon for families or anyone.  There are pornographic pictures of women on the walls.  Filthy, Filthy, Filthy.  There is a lot of negativity around the complex.  Signs that keep reminding you how they can refuse you service at anytime, ""do not take pictures"", ""what part of no pictures don't you understand"", ""warning you will be towed for parking in employee parking area"".  The main complaint would be the carpet in the rooms and the dog smell.  The sofas could use replacing as well.  It would also be nice if you didn't have to smell cigarettes Everytime you entered the front office.  Because of the location of the motel, the internet was spotty at best.  It usually took 3 minutes to get into the room.  The key had to be jiggled for what seemed like forever before the door knob would turn.  Also the ice machine would not put out ice.  I would consider staying again though.",,,0x80c8ba4b9e4b35bb:0xd85fb1d5cf635c8e

They forget to run my medications through both of my Insurances every single time on most of my prescriptions, I get 10 prescriptions a month, and as of today 14 times the have forgotten to do this.

I was so shocked by the tone of her mean voice I actually thought she was joking around at first. When I realized that she wasn't joking & said you don't have to be so rude she gave me a look like she was going to hit me. My friend who was with me & the people in line couldn't believe her attitude. i told her no need to be so rude & she said tell my boss he's here the stared at me again. I was so shocked & a little scared, I wish I would have talked to the Pharmacist about her. Also her co-worker did her all of this & didn't do a thing.

The flight itself was good but very disappointed by the customer service. The transfer to their site missed me at the hotel and didn't bother calling the correct mobile number I'd e-mailed them the previous day to check where I was (they called my UK number which wasn't active).  I was standing about 10 feet away from where I apparently should have been standing. I called the company to ask where they were and was told to get a cab to their site which I would have pay for or i'll miss the flight. They didn't offer to pay for the cab and refused to reimburse the fare. They also refused to accept responsibility for the mistake.

I generally don't have high expectations but this is not how I run my company. It would have cost them just $12 to offer to pay for my cab and would have prevented a very stressful 30 minutes before departure (with two young children) which nearly ruined the trip. The error was clearly Maverick's as I had a reply from my e-mail updating my mobile phone number.

I was told I had to pay my deductible before surgery, so I paid it to the hospital.  Then I get all these bills from the hospital and call the insurance company and they said that they didn't get the money and that I would have to pay in full for everything because of the way the hosptial submitted the claim.  I could never get the hospital or the insurance to show me where my $1000 went, even though I had a receipt.

52262,100518486348831120445,Christina Hwang,1559219455463,5.0,"So I'm going to be completely honest here. I have tried so many nail salons in Vegas..it's insane... I love getting nails..but it has turned into such a nerve-wracking stressful experience from all the horrible customer service... the quality of the nails....etc. I really was about to give up...but driving home I saw Paris nails...and it's super close to where I live..so I decided to give it a shot. Going in, I had a new set of acrylic nails that I only got ONE month ago..... They were ombre, coffin acrylics. I got them from shimmer nails.. (Close to where I live as well) TWO nails popped off the second week after getting them..mind you, I don't do any hard physical labor or anything. I'm sorry, but that place is just horrible. I didn't get greeted..I had to wait when I had an appointment... the workers treated me like they didn't want me there and yeah, the actual nails were horrific... I also got a pedi..and when I came home I took it off and did it myself..I was so upset.... & that is exactly why I was about to just give up! but THANK GOD I FOUND THIS PLACE.

I'll admit..I was hesitant at first...I looked them up here on google..there weren't many reviews..so I knew that they were pretty new...

but them being a new salon doesn't say anything about their customer service, and their dedication towards making sure everything they do is absolute PERFECTION.

I walked in, was greeted...she was so sweet and nice...helped me choose what kinds of colors and designs I wanted.. I decided to go with ombre again...but this time two fingers with the marble design. I was looking at all the samples and wowwww, they specialize in so much cool stuff... all the cool hip nail stuff that's in right now? they can do! I sat..and she took off my nails. Again, she was the sweetest..she was so gentle...she carried conversation with me.. I was already so relieved and actually enjoyed myself for the first time in a long time at a nail salon.
My boyfriend came with me, and she also made sure he was good and comfortable as well! ♥️
After she was done, I sat where a tech named Henry was. Also very nice! and I just felt so relaxed and at ease.
I was talking to him about how horrible my experience was at shimmer..and he assured me that he was going to make sure I love my nails and that I would walk out happy...

He started working..and already I could tell such a huge difference from how he worked to the multiple other places I've been too. HE WAS A PERFECTIONIST. He didn't stop filing..drilling...etc until it looked immaculate.

he told me he had TWENTY YEARS of experience... And IT SHOWED. I have lived in Vegas all my life..& I've never been so happy with the outcome of my nails. He did so good, I was literally about to cry lol

my boyfriend even noticed the huge difference! lol

I finally found a place that didn't make me feel uncomfortable..had amazing customer service AND did a superb job on my nails.

We all want those Instagram looking nails that cost like hundreds of dollars. Well, you can get them here for so much cheaper.

Please don't deter from this place because they are new... I am confident that once you come in...you will keep coming back. Just like how I'm going to. I know we all search and search for the nail salon we love that we want to continue to go back to... We want to feel comfortable...become familiarized with the people who work there...& just be confident that you are going to love your nails...  THIS IS THE PLACE.

Thank you Paris Nails and Lashes.

WESTIN LV: you have the audacity to charge me for our stay ina hot room with a loud AC unit sound. Your hotel manager and front desk staff--should stay at ROOM 608 and experience the LOUD motor sound and NO AC.

There were amazing views a large and beautiful pool and water sports on the lake. The food was wonderful, for breakfast all kinds of fruit, delicious bread and croissants, all kinds of hot dishes and amazing omelettes. We were there in the slow season so most of the little shops were closed. They did have some delicious food and a great waitress in their restaurant. My biggest complaint with this beautiful place is I was traveling with two handicapped seniors and they had to walk forever to get to their rooms. I asked for rooms close to the elevator. We were traveling together and we're not even on the same floor and our rooms were very far from each other and the elevator. One night after finally getting to our room our door would not open. They sent a young man up and he told us we they would have to get a maintenance engineer to change the battery in the lock and it would take 15 to 20 minutes. There was no place for my husband who had bad knees to sit and it was very far to get back to the elevator. Not fun.",,,0x80c8d793b9f80777:0x5187661836fd0829

The Lobster bisque was great! The steak was delicious but they used to much oil while cooking the sprouts. The service was superb not complains there.

My husband was in another hospital in July this year and all I can say is he came out worse than when he went in.
We were kind of  Skeptical about going into a hospital again.
2 things I want to point out, not as criticism.
1. When being discharged we were told to go to discharge (office) to sign out. Our daughter was a little impatient of waiting for someone to bring a wheelchair, so she went and found one herself. Asked the nurse where the office was located. By the cafeteria she said. Well after  searching for 20 minutes my daughter found someone who was kind enough to direct us to the office which is next to the Starbucks coffee. Now when you look at the door to the office there is a plaque on the (left) side that  describe s it as a classroom and then there is a “paper” that say discharge office. Which one would u see?
2nd: my husband was evaluated by PT twice in the 4 days he was there. The first time I wasn’t present. I
was there the second time and the PT spent 20 minutes and that includes putting on my husbands shoes.
He can’t walk without shoes because he had a stoke and needs them to walk well. pT walked him about 15 feet, came back, put him in a chair and left. When the case worker came she said PT recommended a rehabilitation hosp for 2 weeks. We discussed this with her and gave her all the information about the equipment and devices we had at home to care for him to strengthen his gait and get him back to his full strength.

We took the car in 3 times after the first visit for oil leaks from valve cover, left the car for at least 7 days each time. The last two times they told me that it was the front cam seals. I replaced both front seals and the leak was still there. When you looked closely the gasket on the valve cover was protruding out of cover full of silicone. I ended up taking many photos after taking apart to prove they were wrong. Cleaned all silicone off all surfaces.  When I installed new gaskets the leak magically is no longer.  Now they won’t refund any money because they have a warranty Evan though they had the car a total of 4 times at a week each time. If they would stand behind there work this would have never gotten to this point of anger. The biggest kicker is the manager of the store David tried telling me that it never left his store that way. There goes $350 down the drain. This isn’t the first time with different big o stores that I have had some type of problem",,"{'time': 1597422736473, 'text': ""It's very important for us to stand behind the quality of our work, David, so we would appreciate a moment to speak with you offline about these concerns.

Not just in sales but in service too. When I can I get the oil changes and regular maintenance done there, I always feel like I am being treated fairly. Jason W has been my sales person these past 2 times. I leased a 2017 Honda Pilot from him 3 years ago. The sales experience was great and he called me once a year just to check in and see how I was doing and if I had any questions about the car. Then these past few months he called or texted just to check in as my lease was coming to an end. I went in last Monday to turn it in for a new lease. Jason found me exactly what I wanted and at the price I wanted. He spent time to show me the differences in the 2 models and helped me set everything up before I left.  I was toying with the idea of getting a different brand car for several months before I turned this in. But my mind always went back to Honda- both because of my loyalty to Honda (this is my 6th Honda) and because of the wonderful experiences I always have at this dealership. Highly recommended!!",,"{'time': 1581359499219, 'text': 'Stefani, Thank you for the wonderful 5-star review!

Beginning climbers don't know the difference, usually, but as you progress as a climber you want the routes to be interesting.   They should be puzzles to solve.    The way Mesa Rim in Reno makes routes harder is to merely make the holds smaller and farther apart.    This is equivalent to making a ladder harder to climb by just making the rungs smaller and farther apart.    Boring.
Hopefully they will get some better route setters in the future, because it does not matter how fantastic your facility is if your route-setting stinks.

I've been looking for a mount for the AirLux to use with my DFV loupes Skyview model since March of 2020. I have contacted customer support multiple times speaking to different representatives that were not helpful at all and have been charged a few times for mounts and delivery that did not work which ultimately generated a lot of frustration. 13 months later, in April 2021,  Allie got involved and finally solved the problem. She was able to identify the loupes, track down a mount and send it to me. The Airlux light works, I'm on my third led light though since the connection gets finicky real quick and was told it was due to production issues during the period I got my first 2 led's. The third led light I'm using right now is starting to not act right but am reluctant to contact them yet again to experience the back and forth all over again. I like the company's philosophy and values on their products, I just wish I had a better experience. The 5 star rating is essentially just for Allie S.

The people taking the order did not direct the cars in the line so people were lining up in the incorrect order the drink orders were taken. When I received my drink and drove off...I discovered my coffee was not hot. It's been sitting there. I wasted my time and money this morning. When I got to work I threw out my cold coffee because I do not have a means to warm it up. It's very aggravating not to get what you paid for. They need to be more organized and more aware of their customers needs. I tried calling twice and was on hold for 10 minutes before giving up.

When finally seated it was the corner of storage area with trash and champagne bucket with melting ice. Besides it right under the stairs. Called the manager to ask to change the seat. Her attitude was horrible. No apology or anything and told me nothing wrong with the seat and wait until next seat available. Tjat's really bad.

Second, we had to go up or down one floor to get ice...are you kidding me?! and of course the machine on the floor below was out of order!  One of the 3 elevators was malfunctioning half the time.  Then upon check in, they charge my credit card $150.00 more, just in case we used any thing in the room or premium tv (which we never used).  They didn't even have NBCSN (which carries NASCAR) in the Hotel, we had to walk up to Harrah's to watch the race on Sunday.  Now we are back home and I see they only refunded $49.50 of the $150.00.

The food was bland. The veggies varied from raw to squishy. The two entrees I ordered had the meat selections reversed; even more confusing, the chicken was terribly dry and flavorless while the pork was actually tender and savory.

The dining room (I only went inside to pick up my food) was a small square room with handful of tables and a curtained doorway into the kitchen, and that's it. It smelled pretty bad, not at all like the aroma of fish sauce that usually pervades Thai eateries, but sort of like rotten vegetables. Needless to say, I was very glad I was getting food to go.

So what's up with all the high reviews? I've been to at least a dozen Thai restaurants that ranged from fancy to fast-food-adjacent, and Siam Garden now sadly sits at the bottom of the list.","[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipME1aPkEHeCrKrsFUE_is_I-tST04yi72XJPRcy=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNrRCdvr_quafDJ2c8eFwM79GFpHDups-WYL6sZ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]",,0x80c8dd349390843f:0x665e176a89bfd326

89459,102245926556094702834,Eva M,1543472221880,1.0,"I had my Escalade ESV in for a factory recall appointment. Since then I've had several informative calls from Zach about trading in to take advantage of upgrades & incentives. He called again today about their 72mo/0% on 2018-2019 Escalades.
Ok, I schedule an appointment. Zach wasn't a salesperson so I meet with Tina & tell her what I like & that I NEED 2 bench seats, instead of captains chairs like my current model. She tells us that's really difficult to find because it's not a common option, usually only special order for companies, etc.
She kept going out & coming back, saying she was doing one thing or another. We're just trying to see a truck, not talking numbers yet. Finally, she comes back & takes us outside to Sergio (her manager) & they show us 3 models, all the same, black with bench seats. Sergio tells us a casino ordered them then backed out & that's the ONLY reason they had any with bench seats.
They weren’t comparable to the options on my Escalade so I asked about 2019 options. Tina states the 0% offer was only for 2018 Escalades. Sergio then adds that we would also lose the inclusive maintenance option. I asked repeatedly because Zach had specifically called about the 72mo/0% option for 2018 & 2019 Escalades. Tina tells me, ""I need to listen to Sergio & not Zach because he doesn't know what he's talking about."" So we are to believe the man responsible for contacting customers to schedule potential sales & share current incentives/deals doesn't know what he's talking about?
They kept asking about my payment & the balance owed, said they needed that in order to give me a price on their truck. What does the balance on my truck have to do with the price of their vehicle, other than to work the numbers in their favor. Now I'm remembering why we drove to CA for our 2015. We got a better deal over the phone than we could get locally.
As we're looking @ 2019’s all of a sudden they remember they have a 2018 with bench seats & the same options as my truck, plus some! We go back across the lot, giving the benefit of doubt that maybe Tina had found it on their back lot or had been searching their inventory for us & discovered it! Nope. It was literally parked directly in front of the 3 ""company models"" they'd just shown us. They walked us right past it, all the while they're telling us they just don't have Escalades with 2 bench seats that often because it's not really a luxury item like the captains chairs. At this point I'm becoming understandably irritated because they're clearly being evasive & trying to steer us to what they want to sell.
We do the test drive, it’s great and it has the bench seats we need. Plus, Tina told us we'd get and extra discount because it was a 2018 that had been used as a rental/demo truck & had approximately 700 miles on it (& from my guess because they still have quite a few 2018's). It’s now been hours & I need to go pick up our children so my husband says he'll stay & work out the numbers then I can just come back to sign. Thereafter, he said Sergio took over the deal.
To clarify, the sticker price is the same as a brand new 2019 ($105k). Now Sergio tells my husband the only way he can ""give us"" the 0% on the 2018 is if we pay full sticker price. Obviously, the next question is why would we buy a leftover 2018, demo model with 700 miles & not a brand new 2019 for the same price? Sergio then claims we can't get 0% on a 2019 because it's not an offer, but that he'd ""let us"" if we really wanted to go that route.
The dishonesty is unreal. This is old school bait & switch nonsense, all this info can easily be verified online. GM is offering 72mo/0% on a variety of makes/models. He's certainly not doing us a favor by allowing 0% on a 2019, it's a Cadillac dealer incentive.
Ultimately, it was again, a waste of our time. Findlay Cadillac sales are not honest people & they seem to have no interest in moving their inventory unless you want to pay full sticker price, which is likely the reason their lot is loaded and not a single other customer came in during the 3 hours we were there.",,"{'time': 1543726455181, 'text': 'We are sorry you were given mixed up information.

I ordered power supply from them ; I read it's description, image and everything to make sure I'm buying the right one.

And, as you guess, I'm getting exactly what I tried to avoid! I did explain them why I want to return since I got a wrong product  (like I said, no description and different image ,plus, it was very bad quality ) and ask them to pay for shipping. They refused to do it saying it contradict with their store policy, but it's OK to deceive customers. Like most people, I was expecting to get what I see, and when I receive  completely different product , besides been disappointed ,I wasted my time sending it back,looking for another one, plus, paying for shipping, not very good way to run a business.

PROS:
-Semi upgraded appliances
-New or at least very clean carpet
-Well painted
-Comes with a storage closet on the patio
-Garage is only $50 a month
-EASY and quick access to the highway
-Pet friendly
-EXTREMELY helpful manager and courtesy patrol (once you get their direct line)
-Grounds keepers help keep landscape neat since people refuse to pick up after their dogs
-Ceiling fans (you would be surprised how many apartments in town don't have them... why not, we are a desert!)
-Cheaper than equivalent style apartments in Summerlin
-Very safe, even though not gated
-ELEVATORS
-TWO clubhouses and the gym has a proxy card so you can access it 24/7
-Washer dryer work great, they're stacked and in the bedroom
-Decent closet size with shelves
-Pretty large bathroom

CONS:
-Everything is electric (I HATE electric stoves)
-Patio is so tiny it's hard to open the storage door AND have a chair out there.
-The apartment stays warm all by itself. So, since Vegas is MOSTLY hot all the time, your AC will be running at least until November (as mine did, and I only had it set to 78)
-People don't pick up after their dogs... especially people with large dogs.
-The garages are small
-Parking is a joke (more on that later)
-Monthly pet fee per pet instead of just a deposit
-No grass anywhere for pets
-Windows are only on one side of the units (unless you get a corner 2nd+ story unit) so no cross-breeze

On the warm apartment thing... this is nice in the winter. So far I've gone about a month now without needing to turn on the AC, and trust me, I don't need the heater. I had my windows open all night while it was a brisk, windy 45 last week and I STILL only got the place down to 67. Windows are closed and I'm back up to 72. It gets to 74 if I leave the windows closed for a couple days. Longer than that and my AC is kicking on.

*GET A TANDUM PARKING GARAGE*. Trust me. If there isn't one near the unit you want, then move units. Parking is an absolute nightmare. You have to do the math--there are likely 2 cars per unit and I'd estimate.... at least 1200 units. You will NEVER get covered parking. If you can't get a tandum garage then get a regular garage, but make sure your car can fit in it (they're rather narrow--JUST LIKE THE PARKING SPACES). If you need storage (which, you will, everyone here uses their garage as storage) just cough up the extra cash and store across the street at the Storage One so that you can park in the garage.
I have hit someone else's car trying to park in these narrow spaces.
NOT all units are created equal. There is a floor plan with like 5 closets: the master closet, the linen closet next to the washer/dryer, another linen in the bathroom, a coat closet by the door and a pantry in the kitchen. PICK THAT UNIT. I live alone and I don't have enough storage. I literally have nowhere to put my vacuum, so it just sits in the living room as the most atrocious decor ever.
I chose a first floor unit because I'm lazy, but there are cheaper units on higher floors and there are elevators, so it's easier to move into them.

The price is comparable to the rest of the nice areas in town. You can find cheaper, but you're getting what you pay for (high crime and loud neighbors who fight). Prices have gone up, so when a 2 bedroom used to be 875, now one-bedrooms are averaging 950. I looked at units more east and north than this location: they were 950 with dirty carpet, peeling countertops and outdated appliances. The price here ranges from 850-1000 for a one-bedroom, and it's much nicer than the others I saw.

Oh, also, someone threw up over their balcony, from like the 3rd floor, and the vomit went all over my neighbor's balcony wall on the 1st floor. Maybe keep that in mind when deciding what floor you want to live on.

Otherwise, I see others' complaints here, and I disagree with most. Yes, there is a bug problem, but when you call for the bug guy he comes.",,,0x80c892df786df107:0xd70af218443ff502

Usually I do all my own auto repair work.  I'm a mechanical engineer by trade, so I know my way around a car pretty well.  My car developed an oil leak that I didn't want to mess with, so I looked around and found Eurotek online.

The reviews looked good, so I called for an estimate.  The price quoted was just a little over what the stealership wanted for just a diagnostic fee.  Sold.

I brought my car in, and later that day I received a call.  The bad news was that I had misdiagnosed the source of the leak and the car would not be ready that day due to parts unavailability.  The good news was that the repair was actually going to be cheaper!

Leo communicated well, and was in general awesome to deal with.  I would HIGHLY recommend him to anyone looking for a mechanic.",,,0x80c8c68789756e37:0x62b6d8ee262b9285

After giving out some AWESOME steals and deals we wrapped up the weekend with a proud mama bear at Norton National and smiles and hugs from the whole team. Shoutout to the whole Las Vegas team; Carli, Maddy, Mama Norton haha and my girl from Canada Nicole, I can’t wait to come see you there!

Pinball machines throughout pinball history and other old arcade games. Games range from .25-.75 cents, no cost for entry. Some machines don't work but there are so many that you aren't missing out. It is a bare minimum building with a soda vending machine and single restroom but for me it added to the uniqueness. If you are looking for a fancy new facility with the latest and greatest go elsewhere. But for a dive into nostalgia this is a must visit. Spent less than $40 for about 3.5 hours of gaming.

Upon entering the store I talked to John told him I wanted to switch my other line to my wife’s own account and I wanted to look at prepaid plans for that line being switched pretty straight forward.  I even mentioned the same to Ashley helping us.  After purchasing a new phone etc.  I was told the monthly bill would be $70, I replied what about prepaid plans of $40.  Then same guy John whom I asked from the beginning claims I never asked him that.  Really it was less than 20 mins prior and no recollection.  Then Ashley told us we have to switch to a new phone number in order to get prepaid rate.  This is not true the 800 number rep Alex told me you can switch from prepaid to post paid or in my case post paid account to prepaid and keep same number.   A total waste of my time dealing with people who don’t pay attention to detail and don’t know the services they are selling. I would definitely not recommend going to this store.  Also they don’t really know the products they are selling other than reading it off the paper as you look at the same paper.

There was a lady who asked us to gonto spark becuase their office in Lyric dr has jot yet opened. We went there. We faced a very rude lady who stated that “i dont know about your world, but in my world people work hard to get thwir home to live in it. We dont sell for investment”. If you dont want to sell for investment, I dont care but you have no right to be rude to your customer. i work so hard as well to make money for the investment. I do as much good as others in this society. There are people who want to rent the house and investors like me provide homes for them. Myself, my wife and my agent found her behaviour very ackward.
